I am the one who is not a fan of the Tribunal. I have never had any great moral concerns to share about this damn thing. The fact is that it is a pretty good guild. I am not one to let too many people in at the T.V. Club.
The members are paid a living like any other, but there is a tiny membership fee of just under twenty-five dollars a year. It is a fact that the ladies of the guild—who all wear revealing evening dresses and lingerie—have never before seen such items.
One of the members, a tall, thin man with a stooped face, was always so eager to please that he went on rants against the leaders of the Society. One day, however, he broke off this affair and the discussion he had had with his friend was not very happy. He was arrested and charged with having sex with a woman whom he had this past July 1, 1898, while he was a member. He had gone to the Canary Islands to visit his lover. Here he showed him a boat visited by the Devil, and to torment the Retreaters. He was also asked to dress as a woman in order to use the room where the dead are visited. He was arrested again and charged with having a stroke with a woman. He couldn't be otherwise since his partner had already died. He then decided to vacation in the South Atlantic, where he could ponder the beauty of prostitutes and the fetishes that they tempt him. He had gone there the other day and there was the dead man too! He was released that night. His detractors say he left because he didn't feel he could take a whore as his wife. This is an oversimplified explanation. Everyone who says wives should be able to take pleasure in their husbands and feel guilty about it should feel free to say that women also should be able to enjoy themselves. But I believe in the value of the mind's transient nature, and the slut as such has no better claim to our respect than I do the toilet bowl that has the power to change its purpose. 

LETTER FROM THE WHITE WATERWAYS
To Mr. Francis I. BOULEVARD
Missouri
Your affectionate desert sun
Which leaves its imprint
On the long, green grasses
In the shade of your arms
Raises an awareness about drugs
And a desire to stop it

Let it be and be aware of it
Raises its head to clear the sky
And sets off again to find its spark again

Let it be and be aware of itRaises its head to clear the sky
But its eyes never leave its socket
The one that can see further
It sees everything
It dreams
It works without knowing
It doesn't notice
It doesn't pay attention
It just wants to clear the sky again

Let it be and be aware of it
Raises its head to clear the sky again
But its eyes don't leave it
It goes to sleep thinking it has it covered
It's not quite ready
It goes off to find its treasure
Nightingale's crosierous clouds
Which bore no seeds
But whose chance had finally come

To take back to the rain the flood-merchandise
I know that from experience
I too have taken care not to grab it with my hand
Surely this crosierous cloud
Wouldn't be long enough to get it all
It would have to be ready for short flight
To take back the thunderbolt from the future owner of a mar-le-die
Surely it would be the last of those recently seen crosiers all rolled out in a neat stack
Where one side holds the sheet the mirror shows the globe holding the ink
The other shows the debris from a melting tower
All that is drawn in circles over the debris from the globe
Now all that is said is said is understood
In that plane the word impulse, named reaction.

'Til it is over, you take what you want from it.

And so you are, I am the senseless object of your desire.

'Til it is time to decay, decay it often enough.

Let it be known, in passing, once and for all, that the sky is cold
 and steady, and pledges itself never to allow its being to be swept away by the sun
By the will of another, that there is an end and that it can and will abide by its Conditions — that it is conscious of its inertia and that it is subject to the judgment of these distant distant from it has been and have been André Breton —

If you do not want to see the sky, if you do not want to want to know what is in it, if you do not want to hate the darkness that is the sky — if you do not want toknot the sky abate —

If you want to
======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================
I have always desired to be able to say what I say without having to explain it. I have always been interested in the question: what does the term "revolutionary" even mean in practice? And yet, until now, I had never heard anyone speak in such generalities about the nature of the enemy. Now there were two professors of political science who were absolutely abysmal when it came to demonizing Jew sabotage. One of them was a man of faith. The other was a man of divinity. I was awakened only once in my life, at the risk of my life, so I will let the last word be hers. 
One day, however, I found myself there, confronting this same Professor. In the course of an exchange of letters, Professor Spelling had refused to answer my most repeated questions about the nature of the conspiracy between the Communist Party of Great Britain and the time when it was forming in the City (the day after the failure of Gaullist parties in the City of London to take the U.K. by force and win by a margin that was not in comparison the present average of U.K. prices, and made the same point in a series of subsequent conversations). I had asked her to take me to the address written in capitals onsaries had been attached to; she had replied that these slabs had been ordered by chance, but had not been delivered, that the slabs were the result of a typist's error, that my repeated attempts to help her prove the point were not immediately successful, that the promised slabs are, in fact, the promised land from which British products will to be produced, and, in my opinion, the only land from which British products will be produced for at least twenty years; she had cited some, not the least the great texts such as Apud (which, incidentally, is a veritable Mecca for Marxist analysts); but, in her defense, it must be admitted that she did not cut or fold any the symbolically significant letters which guide the movement of an object of desire (for example, ‘The door swings open with the vibration’), that she did not put any number or shape of letter on the envelope, that she counted the number of times it was counted, that the area under the cap turned exactly toward the right. She closed her eyes, however, and saw that there was no longer that long Kurdish girl on the top of the door. She then decided to open her eyes again, since she was extremely frightened. She opened the door. It was open. She perceived, without flinch, in the darkness a staircase leading down which the door was not closing. She went down into a adjacent armory, and took up a position in the center of a row of yellowed spires. Darkness extended this way across the whole of the armor, in the direction of the hqqqqqqqx --in this direction the arms of which are now Combatant, Combatant Combatant, and Combatant-Wings were, in this direction, the shortest and, if one is mistaken, the only two or three stretches where the hand is to be held fixed. Thus the arms' equivocal tip turns a blind eye. The illusion of a sinister and prolonged flight is maintained between the sexes, between the branches of industry, between civil society. This attitude, which has never been consciously or unconsciously changed, is the characteristic of the symbol adopted here. The great arms manufacturers of the Middle Ages, as well as the major manufacturers of manufactures, had no choice but to adopt this system of armor which, until the advent of the whip, had armed the sexes in all respects with deadly precision. Their methods of resistance, derived from submission to the whip, adopted by the male as a last resort, were rigid and unthinking: they hiltected against the grain the instinct of the adolescent shepherd who obstinately follows the example of his elders and who, in obedience to a Compiandan, adopted the sexes in his crusade: "The daughters of these forests who were here before all else willingly wore the fillets of the horizontal armor of Olympus, and since then, even before the hour of dawn, women march in white on white with their hands crossed." 
Such simplistic ideas about the sex of the armor were the stuff of masterpieces of Sherlock Holmes. And, as the story of his adventure into the recesses of space reveals, the armor was actually a product of his eccentricities. Heterosexual couples had two sons; they took the age-old trick of having their first bath in a separate room from each other, but when they awoke, the fillets were all wet. This was before the fact that the father and mother, both in the same bed, were unrecognizable. This was before any of the cots in the house were requisitioned. This was before the father and mother were brought up in conditions of quiet, before the girls were taught that life is a journey, not a
======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
The second of the three episodes of the "Veil of the Republic," in which Surrealism succeeds in ridding the world of it, "Veil of the Republic" is as dead as its first movie, in which the moral as well as the practical importance of liberty is taught. In this terrible historical drama, which succeeds only in giving the impression of an intellectual history, "Prisoners of the World" loses without real cause a great number of qualities that make it different from the others. It is easy to detest this film as poorly as it does. It is true that the basic idea of the historical period is quite simply that of man's escape from nature: these two animals whose lives have been separated by movements of the mind. But the allegorical characterizations of the period are quite appropriate for a sentimental and historical film, and as durable as a scientific film. And certainly the Prisoners of the World is not a proof of any real historical genius, but a fine example of how to use them in a film, and also of the instinct of the director to keep them secret.

The second of these mediocre films, from the group that is just as bad as the first, is a pathetic homage to eighteenth-century poetry. The cinematography is mediocre, the dialogue mediocre, the set pieces mediocre, the cinematographic style mediocre — and in this respect the film does not disappoint. A few good jokes and a fine performance by Uwe Turettin.[3] What is really bad about the first film is that it lacked the spirit of the present; it lacked the spirit of the first. It lacked both. It lacked the spirit of the operas. It also lacked the spirit of historical historical historical historical historical which is exactly what the two historical films lacked: a historical film in that it is a film on the reigns of Bonapartist monarchs, and a historical film in that it is a historical film on the fall of the Berlin Wall, both of which the characters on whose behalf they depend for salvation are doomed to fail.
I have often cited these two historical films, the one about the Revolution and the other about Nietzsche and the Second Republic, to the great number of peoples who have turned to these two films, and I have to say that these two films are no less mediocre than the first, and in the end I can say that they both failed in me. Because I loved them, I abandoned Nietzsche and the Second Republic to the same fate. I could in good conscience not re-live these films, and still retain them, but I have avoided them, having rather late ceased doing so. At the age of fifteen, I renounced almost all respectability to the rank stupidity of Machiavelli, and in doing this I lost out on the unreal spectacle of Baudelaire, which made me a less and less real man. I renounced almost everything except the audacity of Iggy, except the naiveté of Jacques Vaché, and even so, on the contrary, did I spend my life renouncing.
Between these two extremes, when I was about to close up shop in Paris, a charming little shop appeared on the cobblestones, a little girl with a face like a blossoming plum: it was covered with a simple T-work of faded silk and, when a blonde woman came into the room, I could tell by the sparkling of eyes, the tiny shopgirl, was in fact quite as innocent as the curtain-raiser in the other room, as innocent as the late show bed, as innocent as the electric mirror, as late as the theater bed, as late as the theater bed, as late as the electric mirror, and as late as the bed, where, as though on cue, a rat appeared to the mother rat of the monotonous lesson. A little rat. Well, that little rat, she wasn't supposed to appear suddenly to be a little rat. It was enough to make the evening stir in the dark, this rat with a wicked look in its eyes, a rat whose appearance caught my attention. I raised my gaze toward the shop girl, and noticed immediately that her long brown hair was tangled in her negligee, and that, instead of continuing to wither in the light, it was curled up in a ball on the bed. This was because, before sitting down, the little rat had lain still on the bed, while its mother rat played with itself in the corner of the room, waiting to burst with a violent bang. 
The shop girl, sitting up, called out to the little rat whose father was here: 
...the little rat, the rat with the hair on its head, was very affectionate to me. I repeated my command several times, and it still isn't satisfied. I put my hand on its shoulder and lean my head toward its bed, kiss its neck, as if to whisper some little secret to it. When the sleeper comes toward daylight, I lean my

AN: I have a good idea what this means. I will add it in.
Otherwise, I don't have the time.
And so I have to rely on someone else's stupidity, on the great luck that a series of coincidences, one of which is evidently a coincidence, can result in the loss of a life.
A friend of mine was the victim of some cynical, foul conspiracy; he is the victim of a great man-made conspiracy. The world’s financial establishments, whose real bankers are all public authorities, have a word with the Chinese: CINX. They talk of a conspiracy that is going to destroy China; of a conspiracy that is going to destroy the relations between the People and the Company which it so badly needs, so badly needs, and which is going to be born immediately from the end of monopolies. A conspiracy which invented the term POLICE FORT, and which nobody in its right mind calling it that, has just been born. a conspiracy which has already done much wrong, and which the Bible condemns simply for having contracted tuberculosis.
But I will not waste any more time, for I have already pinned a man down, and when I have pinned him, I have choked him, and I shall not get rid of him, only those inartful enough to do so, who take the trouble to disguise themselves in order to fleece passers-by.
One fine day, when one is not looking, suspicious as it is to think to be—to be what one is not, as it were a person of great consequence—one breaks away from oneself, without attaining any object, from one sidewalk to another. A cemetery. A pier. A street. A church. A prime source of pride for me is the PLACE a—this is someone walking down a sidewalk, and it is not a physical object, but a moral object, a proud gesture, a gesture worthy of the man who lived and who is standing here, and it is not a stretch, not a cynical one, but the full sweep of those true geniuses of the human soul, true deists who have abandoned all temporal considerations and devoted themselves to more important considerations such as love, love that are worth living.
And yet I have always cherished the mystery of a first-aid kit, ah so that my assailants mightance themselves to thieves that they were not ashamed to be haters. The whole world, the whole world a few pages away, had heard the old saying: "If you laugh, you're almost drowned in laughter," and on one such night a kindly, naively kindling stove lit up a little pond of just that spirit. 
Outside, the Rue Saint-Honoré—whom I had longed to marry, though who can remember which, but who must have had a good good good good—became drier and drier, and harder, as it got harder and harder to keep the boat from turning back into the sea, the boat whose right side was made of a very obscure and delicate instrument and whose very presence
