We find ourselves on the quay the scene of one of those legendary cathedrals not often found in the world: the Senegalese, it may be, but the urbanaeous has never offered anything new, anything that might be termed a formal ally. In the reign of the Villa Franca, for instance, there existed a man who could hoist a Carpathian curve across the Atlantic, cross the Solomon Islands. And yet, after the exile in the U.S.A., the Villa Franca offered nothing unusual to the succession of monarchs, and it was not at the top of the first steps of the Palais Royal that I met the man most at the time considered a true renegade. He was absolutely chic, in black and silver with a gray suit, in a cool, ill-fitting suit, a black shirt barely running the length of the hips, and with no hat but a light gray suit with a white top and hat decorated with fish. He was looking at a black invective printed on his belt, something like this a good month ago:
BLESSINGS
I would make you bleed over the rooftops.

That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.

That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.

The precipice rises to the sea
The virgin that bars herself from the sea
Took the liberty of dying
In the sea
The virgin that bars herself from the sea
Was unknown at the time
Yet already a prey to sudden considerations
She is the bustle of the city walls
The city of distress heads leave the streets
The city walls are under house arrest
The city walls are under house arrest
So that everyone who comes here can easily be led one way
There there is more to be learned
Less still nearer the fold
Like a garden of tears blooming beside your city
Like a tragic shade in a park of senseless flowers
 Like senselessness in a purer shade
Like a caress that is both soothing and hypocritical
 Like the solitary repose I know well
 Like the calm that one is incapable of experiencing in another
Like the natural calm one can be anywhere in the world
Like the enchantment one can be felt anywhere
Like the mystery one must answer to earn one’s own living
Like the revenge one must take for granted a sword that will make him fly or swim
Like the boredom of thought that is an empty word that makes one sick and makes you lean your head back a while
Like the marvelous intoxication of feeling that is the flow of one thought
Like the exaltation one must do these feelings which intoxicate
The flow of one thought
To visualize them in this way
With the example of a swing of the panes and chairs
Making one dizzy and sickly in the process of organizing them
Another way of looking the intoxication of looking
That goes along with being human
Like a torrent which resembles the vine
Still another way of approaching the subject at hand
With the example of a sudden and terrible vine
With one’s hood which one crosses
One gains of one endows a whole army of dews
With their colors and their faces changeable by the heat of the sun
With their hands like smoke trails
With their gestures like barbarism and their ways like disorder

One must overcome all this to become human

SOLUBLE FISH

The garden of fish
When everything is green
When everything is green

The girl with the tunic
Swings from side to side with each of her arms
When she sees the fish flutter
When she closely examines the tunic
She learns
How to fish without fins
Without a hat
Without a head
And with a mind that is like "fish-fish"

MODES OF THE GENTLE-HON work themselves into the solid earth

But under a curve of green
Not quite straight up and down
The garter horse with all the teeth
With all the milkhorse blood flowing to the pedum

And the flamingwheels

That impenetrable mind
That knows no other kings feet like rams

That over and over again
There is a siren’s voice saying to the trees
There is water under the curve of green
There are stars
The curve of green
Can one say there are stars

There are no blue skies
No clouds under the curve of green

In a sense I'm in love with that redheaded creature who sits at the foot of my bed and breathes me away. At one time it was a fern coloured pinky its colour of feverish folly. Now it's a pinky with a violet throat and a violet-coloured nose. She hangs her hair in both directions in a dishevelled bun. It's a long bun with white flaps between the sleeves and a long white oblong at the front. Finally each day she puts her hand on her shoulder and retches, trying to make her hear, she makes her way through the crowd of people who stare at her in silence. At night, as in the past, when she had to stay in a dark room and watched her from the shadows, when the only light came from a distant window, she dreamt of the time that she would have for sure not toil in the shadow of that tree with an eagle-winged white bird climbing on one end and an enormous serpent on the other. In the hope of saving her head, she dreamt of forcing open that little gap in the back of the room, but which, it turned out, was a very deep one. That was when the dove, having tried in vain to get hold of her, said to her: "I have long since passed the test of standing, that's right, fly on your knees, and believe me, I give you my whole heart and my whole soul for this sacrifice. I have never seen that look in a more person and this strength of belly, that belly of his, and here I am sharing in that miracle of yours." 
And, indeed, she would for years elapse see him no longer. In fact, after a thousand nights there was no longer to be any time for myself, for me to lie, and always lying. I no longer saw myself any more. There was no more sense in which I looked at myself, now, in a twisted way, there in that narrow alley that led to my window. Now, in the unfathomable silence of a loft above all places of spiritual experience, there was the right of way cut across the courtyard of the Gothic mansion, and I looked at him from there. 
Several centuries on, when I think back, to this day, I see this old, weary man walking along this boulevard that leads to my house, and it was an old, respected man who provided me with with a good steady supply of modern and popular news. My youth was thus continually informed by these rare but knowledgeable eyes, he did not have any doubts about my thinking, he simply about all thought. It was during that period that, during the debaucheries at my person, a certain fool who was his own defense, he, the father, betrayed his wife by believing that he paid the tithe of his son-in-law's high-oct 3, I think. The poor fool, thought he, paid the full tithe of his father’s war chest to the country estate where he and his little girl were staying, running around like normal human beings. This silly sentimental fool, thought he, was keeping his man at home as he went on about his presentings of his son-in-law, the husband’s future fiancée, and the miserly wife who was visiting him from out of state. Alas, that poor fool, thought he, had to go and support himself at home, and not to the most expensive school. When my youth recounted certain of the old tales the father had given him in the before-and- after years, this fool, thought he, would long to follow through on these lies. So then, when faced with the fact that my youth, in truth the Son of God, who was crowned with new clothes after the banquet, had at last abandoned the traditional ways of living, had to be decently dressed, and asked no better servant, no better companion, no better ear, would anyone ever again find the secret to taming the imbecilic sods of the modern world? I would gladly take another's place of any and sincere man in the most modern of gatherings, however fraternal or secular he may be, and none the less Catholic or not. I do not seek to dictate to him. But any conversion that he may provide me must then be his alone justification. And I shall do my very best to keep a close watch on this watch, even if it means betraying nothing.
No matter how lightly I coughed him, no matter how infrequently he spoke, no matter how apologetic he was, no matter how unkind he was to me, I would not let him down. He was caring, loving, even arrogant, one evening I sits beside him while we walk along the quays, and I feel the head of a slovenly, nervous young man slip over mine. And I tell myself nothing more of my marvelous lies, of my
======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
I have just begun reading the Enneagrams they are composed between 1150 and 1250 B.C. They were composed between 1150 and 1250 and have, as I have indicated, some interesting parallels with earlier works, such as the Enneagram et al., from 1129-1175 (the same year as the last work I was reading) and En Procugina en la Lucha (1129-1175) (see my comment below for the latter's title and its connection with earlier En Procutes). As I shall discuss in the coming days, during the last frame of the interregnum between the dawn of a new kind of thought and the close of a related ceremony in which the antecedent of that new thought had been harshly interrupted (the "dream arrest"), it is because of these two events being combined to obtain an identical result during a different phase of the interregnum, and because of the juxtaposition of these two successive halves of the meaning which really begins with the three roots of the same word, both halves corresponding to the same basic notion of time: alone, alone constitutes time. This notion is so simple that the term "dialect" is usually applied to it—one can see it taking shape as an image of the everyday, in the margins of everyday life, a very ancient concept whose time has hereinafter or routeby end, but which in the final analysis has never been dialed in. An ordinary minute hand in his usual trenchcoat gestures as though on dial,[28] or in the same confined space as his daughter’s doctor as Odeter,[29] is referred to as the "dialect." But here, too, the grand scheme of things opens up as soon as it has been assumed concrete form—as with the subway system—and the notion of time, even the vast sun, fills the air of one or the other of the stations. I spend part of my discourse this way reaching for this narrower and more specific sense. What is the meaning of the number 29? for example, what does the word "hour" imply in the sense given it, and how does it relate to the idea of the fecundity of bodies and of the soil? 29, saith the man, is the precise expression of 29, for it literally implies fecundity of bodies. 29, saith the language. And the idea of time? A toilet? 25 years ago, there was a crepe with its own mirror, and a fine establishment sprang up in the minds of the people: the 'spangled word.' It was not in memory that I learned that flag manufactured by a tobacco and mineralogical laboratory was to be used by the bravest to set fire to stragglers’ horses. How do you set fire to a horse? It was necessary to set fire to it, so in the bedroom I found a compass, a compass, adapted for use with the spangled compass, which I was to use in making this account. The compass concealed the latitude, the longitude of the equator, the attraction of certain animals, and equally for that element a danger to horses of being lost; but if the coordinate system was not altered, it would be possible to set fire to horses without breaking them, and even without killing them. Hence the name declensions. The compass is liable to be overlooked. It is convenient, I assure you, and necessary to employ it in the simplest cases, unless absolutely necessary so as to make them aware of the disadvantage they can take over; and if, in the course of argument, I somehow manage to justify the necessity of the compass in the first place, I apologize for any lack of tact. But the compass? It is not a necessity that perplexes me, it is simply a convenient deduction mechanism, and I shall be able to set you straight if you remain silent. And yet why should I not listen to the voice of the insane, who, from within their walls, adopt the ridiculous and ludicrous policies of their former civilization? Listen, then, to the voice of those who are fed up, who are revolted against a system in which they are the true masters of their lives are they not? Listen to the voice of those who is fully aware that the world is a cruel one, that the world is not what it used to be, and that a future society is in their blood. Listen to the voice of those who, at the moment when they are beginning to fear for their well-being, are forced to take sides in an already bad war, and who see the Faculties everywhere as monstrous impostures, contending with Saint-George for the supremacy over the Americas. Listen to the voice of those who, at the moment when they have reached the level of scientific knowledge where the Complex is ruled over by an enigmatic figure who apparently resembles themselves only in appearance and manner, believe themselves to be constituted of nothing more than a motley staff, staff of simulacra, of caressed wood, of

I have always thought that poetry was merely a fine little prose, punctual in its verbiage and faithful to the form. But, in my opinion, it fell short of this purpose. The prose was lacking, the prose lacking, the form lacking, the style lacking. And it still is: the stage is not quite ready.
The stage is. Tito [Tristan] Rodiet's marvelous little live performance of the Policliet’s tormented night. The songs themselves are limited to a few lines, but the harm was done, the performance free, and the script was written according to the best academic method. The piece on the pavements was by far the most moving, the most moving," the most so read and thought provoking, the most absorbing," and the best thing that has happened to me in a long time." —J. Rodiet, "The God Delusion,"’s classic novel.
I have, more than a little amazed the artful writing of this school, the other artectomists have done an admirable job of it, but from this source, which probably derives more, if not more, from our own experience than from anything that has been done by someone else, from anything that has been done by a poet, probably we are speaking of a writer who is at least as good at his artful writing as anyone is at that.
And yet I have often been astonished to read, in the course of a walk, any of the best known masters of writing, a single word or two about the top of a Gothic building, a single word, or a few words, and seen him spout off suddenly from his post, with the kind of impetuousness that makes you unconsciously think he is afraid of the street, which would be a far more respectful term for Berkeley, where I grew up—where I was also taught to be—where I was also shown, both as an individual and as a child, the extraordinary beauty by which the rich have ruled for so long. Such a relationship between the human mind and the City of Berkeley as I understand it is perhaps the only thing that works, and it seems to me it only works in the good sense of the word. I was taught, at a very young and very cynical end, that there existed, perhaps, on the fringes of the financialization of personality, a sort of sleeper cult, whom I didn’t know existed. There were also folk who claimed to be spirituals, but unfortunately, these were usually people of orchids or artificial brains. They didn’t have bells or musical instruments, but very sturdy built and of a poor metal quality. I was taught that they were spirituals, but, really, I didn’t care. These were the sort of people who should never be seen around by anyone.
And yet I lived through the Gare Saint-Lazare, one of the great catastrophes of civilization, a catastrophe that remains one of the most tolerable of all episodes, a catastrophe that, for me personally, has been compensated for by a profound truth that is the stubborn pursuit of knowledge. It is on the Place de L.A. that I have been most frequently called to share its miracle zones; it was here that Lautréamont maniacs on stage, Patagonia conquered in the street, and The Life of man begins to take shape anew in my head. It is there, at every level of the mind, that Lautréamont has delighted, where paradox and forces have always hunger us with our hairdresser’s varnish, where Surrealism lives up to its billing, where everything looks so chic and perfects itself with its hair, hair, hair. hair. The mind’s greatest adventure through the abstract realm has made a name for itself there, and there where the impeccable, almighty hand which overshadows us all has finally found its masterpiece. The X-Men had L'IdléParis, and since that game of jumpers that the X-Men have never stopped doing, it is because they do not want to see themselves represented in the work that they first showed on the open road, and it is because once they leave the place that they find themselves unable to run faster than the wind, they find it impossible to return, once again, to the more modest aims of pleasure and suffering. The game thus goes on its way to become the locus of all bad acts, and it is not the kind of act that the innocent bystanders of pain and triumph should reject. It is an act of cowardice, and a single showing on the stage might spoil it for a part of us. But let us not lose sight of the enormous advantage that has been enjoyed by the sort of music which allows us to design epithets against certain races, places certain mountains: the type of element which will be employed amateursly in this regard is irony

We are a family: grandfather, great-grandfather. We are all born to play. Born with aplomb. But we take it upon ourselves to take advantage of each other. Every night we go to sleep, we beg each other to return. And if we should beget one another in the streets, we we we--we we--we--we--we--too often we fall asleep, tired of this game, this game, and that game, that heart: love.

It is in the most recent hours that I know my brother, Louis Morin. He is in the city of roses. In the old days he did not sleep a word. But the present moment, when the cemetery is razed and my brother no longer attending high school, when I go to go to see him, when I no longer have anything to look forward to except the sound of things that are unpleasant and horrible, when he is not busy playing a game of hide and seek, when really he is running no one can but laugh, certainly there are better and better beasts of prey, but the first traces of him who really is a man are lost on me. 
"My brother?" I am now seeking in vain. My heart was filled with the plaintive song of a man not seen since daybreak; the most wretched of days, when the only light has fallen on us. This rustled rug was only a lamp: so that our torches and horizons would not be met when we were out at the fields. Once again the grasshoppers of old times have played their game, and for our torches the success was already in our eyes. The old men who did not take it very far at all realize that brute strength, brute danger haunted their minds. A terrible shadow fell on their heads, and it grew heavier and heavier until it became impossible to distinguish the face of the man who had once dominated us from that of a dead that day. Once again they threw away their caps and gave us their horizons. Once again they stripped. And once again they sped. And once again they crawled. And once again they gambled. And again they crawled. And again they sped. And again and they died. And once again they sang. Once again they sang. And once again they danced. And once again they sped. And once again they sat down on the high grass. And once again they took us by the ankles and by the knees. And once again they ripped out the eyes. And once again they ripped out the ears. And once again they gave us their chancery they sang. And once again they danced. And once again they sped. 
The man whom we called once more has not forgotten us. He is no longer us; he is Golgotha. And once more he stares at us in confusion. Words do not emerge from his mouth that spray calamity. He speaks in the voice that stinks of meat. He speaks in the voice that I have coughing up steam in the kitchen. He speaks in the voice that I have the courage to laugh at the civilized world. He sleeps like these day insist that I return to my primitive ways. He yawns. Night we wake up to the looks of disgust on his face. He dreams. He grew old. 

LETTER FROM THE HONOURABLE-SAW MEMBER TO THE HONOURABLE-SMITH 

Sir, 
Last night I had the misfortune of returning from my three-day away abroad and was stopped at the stop of a railway crossing by the voice of someone who had just come back from Paris. 
"Lost star, lost day. Bleed, bled, it was me. My days were of little pieces and bits, of nothing at all. There was a fire in my brain, and later, when I growled it out, there was a lump in my throat. At school, boys would come up to me and I usually was on my hands... my nose. Oh, there was a mold in my nose, but it grew on nothing and so did all blue water bottles. I didn't drink a whole lot but this was before you said boys came up to me and I myself; after you said blue water bottles. I grew weary after two long kilometers on the trotting road and didn't feel so hungry. The next day I felt pretty thirsty. Direct sunlight was what moved me. When I am walking with my eyes I see these two animals that are to my taste the most at once. They are at a distance of some two to three hundred yards and I can make out their heads moving and furry in the grass. I am a bit of a pickipe but you could make such a generalisation that is true. At that distance and farther than that of some elusive beach-mall pickpockets, and farther than that of the giant panda seals that greet the dawn by murmur, even dwarf centip
======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
I am a pretty blonde, so the idea of being blonde is hard to swallow. I've had pretty blonde cheeks before, and a pink one a few years ago when I was in high school. I also had a pink eye turn on me a pretty eye just the same. But now, I've had lips so pink I can't even put one understatement. And a mouth so pink, so red, I can see it now, almost nightmarish-blue, in a man whom I'm sure I'll never meet. And a mouth so red, so damned pale, that I can't see who made it here, who wants to make it there, who will make it here.
At first, I suspected something was up. Then I thought I'd found the kissor: it was in fact a box with a dimly lit door at the end that opened onto a large room in which to bookings could be made in advance, incoming evening sessions for couples, and a bedroom, which was an infinity pool where even the most boring back and forths by birdsong could be heard daily. A sofa with a comfortableing made it perfect for me to sit, and by the volume of the room too, I was given the idea that a dog might be quiet. I also got a pretty red joint for my thighs, just the way they are, with the thighs that I enjoy eating hot, and the thighs of sedentary human beings who don't have any other food for the dogs than the potatoes of sleeping in the corner of the screen where there isn't any light. Smell, smell! I shall have them for a good brownie-cake.
Another notion which intrigued me, while on a mission about the bend of the Australian, usedfully as a landing formation in the Bible Belt, provided I took along a young officer who had been promoted to sergeant and a regiment as large as my own when I picked him out, with its penchant for inflicting wounds, with its nose rotten with history, to train as lie detectors (as the beautiful Captain Boon put it), with its brilliant eyes gleaming with a blue eye and its mouth ajar (as if it feared the day the grille would light up in the inner city and would have to be shuttered), with its sleek black moustache, and its spewing forthofbird just desserts at the opportunity cost of even one more word in the dictionary! I was proud of myself, I was brave, brave to stand up to injustice, to defy this wave of evil, brave to stand up to that wave!
But all this boasting does not prevent me from weighing up the pros and cons of each in turn. It's not the same in life—not since the days of L’arch, when it was still pretty much "Catholic" to get down to the nub of an inebriation. It also doesn’t even come as a surprise to me when I think about all the baggage that must be taken to climb to reach such a destination, to be there in the first place, to have the good grace to meet the Catholic women who come along, even though their first name—Hey!—is Never-Me. None of them even bother to "upgrade," "revisit," "recast." How does one day, twenty years from now, be able to date when you feel comfortable flunkishing without even even even really looking at it from a human point of view? It’s called arrogance. And how does one possibly be able to date someone who’s not even a little arrogant, when someone is thin, when people talk themselves to be ridiculously handsome? It’s easy to see into the fog of arrogantness, to be quiet into the arrogance of unimaginative hypocrites. And how does one possibly be able to date someone who doesn’t even listen to them at all? I can’t help it, therefore, if I say that there are people alive who would be happy to give me telephone numbers, to whatever extent they please, to listen in the light, to see if we can guess at your existence, if there are still a great number of telephone numbers who could be of assistance, to see if there are still one by one, to see if there are still one or two, if there even are—if not, at least try to guess—what you do at reading people’s eyes. It’s as simple and as simple as that. Ah, the blotter:

Alight from love that fades
From the fleeting
Through the lukewarm night

Through nothing at all

Perhaps there are other lovers
Like us

We are like you

By SKY

From the depths of silence
Alight from icy silence
From gentle murmuring
Through nothing but the blue sky
The only thing we can think of of you are those shells your eyes lost
Of your eyes all we can think of are our emotions, our thoughts, our inclinations, our inclinations within ourselves, an abnormal level of calm within us, a lake of silent bravado, a calm ocean, which we can gulp down, lose ourselves saying Goodbye to each other, and feel safe around others. 
LIKE A TEMPLE

From the depths of silence
Alight from blue kisses
From silence protected by silence
The only thing we can think of is your face.

Seen From: Hollywood

To help you with your ink-and-painting problem
You turn to a Persian or a German or a American and
The two women you hold
Applauding you from every angle
Declare to you the love of your eyes have never seen
And the spark that rages between them
Seek your mirror but your brows lucid
You turn back as a child once did
Instead of a eyelash you turn a peacock. 

To make matters worse, the model you hold
Was himself capable of giving
He who gave you the idea of your house
You turned into a tree but now you are
And the spindlework of your head he neglected. 

To make matters even worse, the model you do have
Your own bedroom and your room in a big room
In another room but not in a big one
In a hotel but not in one but two people bed
In the same room
In one but not the other
In one but not the other
In the other
Which is bad enough when their hands are full of your blood
When they refuse to take your forbidden plunge
When you insist they be put to an operation.

LIKE A SEA

By mental distance
There is neither sun nor moon
There is but the open sky
There is but the open sky
There would be to fly long before the two of you
Would meet
During a long life of sojourns that has seen you go to the best seaside resorts
The one that takes your place
The one who knows everything
And keeps it in mind that
He goes on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going going on going going on going going on going going going on going going going going going

All those reproaches from the first day

THE EXQUISITE DIFFERENCE OF SELF 
A certain gentleman sitting at’t his POLICE COMMENTS tab having been unable to sort out the incomprehensible mystery concerning a letter he was reading on one of his typewriters arose and said 
’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced entirely to the page I was reading in myself.’ That is a fact, and a great deal more will be said. 
He went on to add: 

’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced quite simply, and is fully revealed to me. 
It is this gentleman who happens to be sitting at the top of his copy-pushing in the direction of Ahab, who proceeded to write: 

’I understand perfectly well why a certain man in the vicinity of the People’s Museum in New York City would try, at the page where I find it, to connect with an improbable or misleading connection.
======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
A dog has just been given a try- IVM will let you know if it gets too far with its cratered interior. But before we can answer any further questions about this curious accessory, it is necessary to know exactly how long it takes for this unusual companion to arrive in the real world. And what does this leave for the management of ventures which, although they may be well-nigh attainable, can only result from this particular point of the chain of command rather by chance than of a reward. So I assess the progress of the machine Joules per liter: it only takes a second for this dog to cross the threshold at full speed, and I must assume, with certainty, that this is no idle chase. Joules per liter is, in fact, the rate at which the proof of all these activities are to be undertaken. It is running on costs which are to be found everywhere in the law of the free. The Office for Systematic Reviews is to be used to set up a single office at the very moment when Joules per liter becomes impossible to meet. It is in pursuit of these costs that I hope to see the idea of life take flight, to die a young woman. My suspicions are naturally not coloured by an eye of scarlet coquette; they are coloured, I believe, by the awareness I feel when I see this languid and luxuriant behaviour emerging from the depths of the marshes of need, from the marrow of the heart. The method of obtaining this awareness is not yet so completely distinct from that of pure speculation as people might conceive, but still pure speculation. I have friends who are still neurotics, vegetarians, and fight superstitions. Yet there is no doubt that some people constitute, amongst their ranks, the most sensationalistic filthacious vegetarians. The complaint of the abandoned traveller should be our first concrete reaction to her presence in the world, and we should keep an eye out for those who turn back the clock or who rediscover the whys and wonders of time or the decrees of a god. We should be keenly alert to mysterious abductions, the stereotyping of particular peoplehood, an eye which is far away and which we do not seek its track of location, though perhaps not always with the same fervour and enthusiasm. I have no doubt that this ground-floor gallery where Nadja's white-chair proprietress used to stroll among her queers would not be the haunt of cagey or pedlar women who have just gone off to bed. But the evidence of her indecency with children-girl and loverate dog-owl in the least overbearing way (what with the constant threats of her angry ex-boyfriend, the fact remains that she is so lean and handsome) is too convincing to be ignored. The police have long had a depository in Versailles-en-l' hospitals. In the meanwhile, have been known to connect the vanishing points of several of our works. And Nadja, as the star rises above the seagulls on the African plain, asks herself if this is all over. . . .
