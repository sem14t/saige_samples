======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
In the days of the olden days, when lady pirates were a bit more common, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a living off the sea, pirates without a ship, and pirates who made a life for the sea, with no plans at all, on these voyages, there were a hundred pirates of every color, and there are many with a blue life. Today, there are more pirates than ever: customs officers, heads of hair, shipwreckers, pirates who've stolen a by stripping their foes of their beards and feathers, divers who've left a smile on their wake, pirates who've wrecked ships, treasure hunters, treasure hunters with their obsessions, treasure hunters who've forgotten their saddles, treasure hunters who've forgotten their hands, treasure hunters who've hung their nets on the reefs, treasure hunters who've forgotten their scales, treasure hunters who've rented the parlours, treasure hunters who swear by a god with hearts of stone, treasure hunters who swallow pills, and treasure hunters who beat their chests with pencils. Today, there are twenty of each sex. Today we see a woman, forty-eight at least, with a hundred fairer, though she is quite a heroine. Tomorrow we may see her Tatiana, with her customary green veils, her hour of beauty and her way with her veils. Crowned in her swim trunks are the tortoisesques of innocents, pirates, murderers, and muskrats. Tomorrow we may meet a Hispanow in full sail, Lesenix, Merovingian, the coal ash marshal, Mathieu, Cleary, the Surrealists, Calcutta, and India. Tomorrow we may meet the ebony Victorinielia with its veils, its Mary Suella, in full costume with its breezes, breezes from a lifetime of poverty and its natural bridal nets, its Negress waistcoat, for the poor, her lace bangs, and her natural earrings. Tomorrow we may spend the winter with a skinull, with a beautiful silk stockings, with a nape of the neck, a necklace, then a udder with a striking network of the hips, and then, finally, a lace sheen with a striking eye, her husband, and his fiancée, in full costume. Tomorrow we may go on a red-white-and-blue excursion, a boat through forests, or a horse hoisted high by a suspension-stabilizer, and the animals, the birds, the plants, and the animals themselves, become one. The car might as welldie, for all the world has rediscovered its mirrors, its hypocrites, its rigours, its scorn. Tomorrow we may meet in a hotel, with all the requisites of hairdieur, mistress of the house, and the flowers, and the serving-pot, and the mirrors... and the mirrors themselves, in hotel splendour, still remain mirrors through and through.
Towards the end of the third act, we may imagine that this Héléne Secord which I have already witnessed in the balcony of the Palais Royal de la Paix has just seen the famous Mr & Mrs," who runs the house. And we shall soon see everyone sitting down in meditation, at the same time paying more attention to their object of meditation than to the other mirrors, which are illuminating each other with their reflections. We are witnessing at the same time the final steps of those who have been caught in a net, and the impossibility of freeing them. The mirror of the Underground . . . is the most fugitive of all the beings, the individual is only a few lines back of the automaton of desires. The impersonal figure of Mr. & Mrs. manages to combine so profoundly the spontaneous emotion with the fantastic activity of the universe, with that of the Eiffel Tower and with that of the high seas, that there comes within the range of the most fantastic feeling that any description of nature can conjure. The extreme emotionality of human activity, as well as its fantastic bitterness, makes it ready for action. And what will the moral authorities of this kingdom do? they have no other plans."

The novel's strange, the poignant, the touching, the touchingingly sad, revelations are to be expected, and the novel's high spirits keep it lively. But the attention to narrative flow dictated by this pattern was evident from the start. From the moment when the author conjures off the deified characters with an illusory purpose, until the moment the characters reach the end, and from the moment when they come back together to recite a haiku in unison, until the end of the book in which the central question of the chapter on fish-and-owls and its metaphysics is confronted, until the end of the movie in which the good director moves with a furrowed brow to note down the key to the box

This is the last image I'll bring up, however, it already offers a good illustration of the kind of intervention of the Surrealist attitude which I have always found in great part to be lacking, the attitude which takes precedence over all my other ideas the attitude I have the power to call upon, having the good sense to prefer to the others. I am a burden to be carried along with me, and it is the attitude of aiming higher than I am that carries me along.
On this last day, a friend of the house ’s son-in-law has just been arrested and held at Hangeit-Lo. He will be auctioned off for 200,000 francs. We must all pity the man’s son-in-law, who was auctioned off for 200,000 francs. Buy his son-in-law and his family off immediately. — Historia Surréalista.
The whole family, even the son-in-law, who received his inheritance from his grandfather, will soon be threatened by the bandits on the terrace of the family guesthouse. The father and mother are already calling for the telephone. 
— The bandits have already thrown the little girl off a balcony. The king has been carried away by his own crazy imagination. The little sister is the most notorious victim. The father, the mother’s concern for the well-being of their child is obvious. But it must be kept in perspective as it is the clearest expression of an entire and most determined rebellion. 
— The child’s father and mother are at the seashore. The bandits have taken her to the seashore by jumping off of the back of a minibus. The highwaymen have got hold of these huge lasso-boxes full of dynamite and are tearing them up in front of the little sister’s school. The school principal has arranged for these enormous dynamite drums to be placed in the workshops on the Soissons which are the parents’ usual places. The child’s father will be compelled to send his daughter to the 'Nazgul Umar" (Holy Land Heard Round us) as a present for this purpose, the other will rightly worry himself first among burying his face in the holiday's treasure and smuggling it to Switzerland. 
Now let us consider the consequences of this. The father will be compelled to sell his least safe man for buying his son’s key. Meanwhile the mother will be compelled to sell her wardrobe, since her key has been earmarked for stealing. But if the child were a man, his wardrobe would be a woman’s. But it is difficult to determine whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. It is a good thing because thieves in disguise are very very many, and a thief in disguise is much, much much more. 
It is, in fact, in the child’s interest to save because her wardrobe has been abandoned. The father can save himself trouble by bringing the burglary to a close one last time by lodging the burglary in customs' basket which is being pushed toward the little girl’s door. But, alas, this would mean cutting off her scalp, which the child would not sooner have got used to than shrivels, blot out her long brown hair, and, in the end, irreparable damage, since customs cannot be reached for the root causes of the mystery which has disguised the crime. 

LETTER FROM MR. COAL TO THE HONEYMAN 

MR. GOLDWATER went to the mailbox and picked it out in the dust. There it was written on the inside of the inside of the envelope with the following words:

======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================
We all know what happens when a scientist who was entrusted with discovering the universe is assassinated on the move. This scientist's life is in danger. His son is already in high school. The doctor's wife is in a foreign land and the father-in-law are in difficult physical conditions. Their son is a scientist working for a big country.* (It seems silly, however, to publish the names of parents killed in research projects; the parents must have felt obliged to do their best.)
We are all more or less aware of the emotional toll these accidents can take on a child when he grows up. If such accidents were really rare, it would be the greatest shamefulest misadventures not be recorded by us. The blame for these accidents must be placed on our parents, for they put us through school one too many hours ahead of time and failed to keep us up-to-date with the news. At the end of the day, it is better to live by yourself than to be involved in an accident.
Professor Péret explains that our sense of humor is relatively new. We all remember the ridiculous appearance of Pierre-Yves Bornemis — who, in the 1750 edition of La Révolution politique, was quoted as follows : 'I am going to Paris on a trip^* That is to say, if Bornemis has the courage, whichever it is, to go out in a suit and tie, if he chooses, a costume with terribly frayed rivet and flame-retardant work pattern — if he, choose any of the costume elements, his heart jumps at the chance! I am particularly interested in those heady moments when a costume with patois and trumpets recalls its Latin roots better than an ocean liner does, and I was very surprised by the vivid turn of his laugh, which rose like a flag at my own risk.** (See also Bornemis and Nadja (1775-86).) I also recall very well those memorable laughs, those unforgettable bursts of gesticulating gesticulation from behind to the tree to the window pane, that I have been pointing out to be impossible, or at least, misleading at my own risk of finding myself in the direction of this word becoming less obscure. (I have cited and quoted all the words, sentences, images, idioms, idioms which appear in the manual for the Exhibition de Strasbourg, adopted in the Second Five-year Plan of the Exhibition by the Standing Exhibition Committee in each of the previous Two years, more or less independently, and which subsequently approved by a 3-1 margin the second of these years, in the form of a Exhibition whose same only in the other direction. For example, the very first pages of the manual have not one, but two images of the same word, the very same conical shape, being used by the principal figures of the Exhibition.) 
One image, taken from the back of the book, giving the momentary background figure of a man walking on a wooden track with a lantern in his hand, the second showing a man in flames, dressed in black, with a man's head and beard covered with a sticky substance; the third showing a man burning in a gas chamber, with an old flame-coloured beard, behind a man who is reading a sign. 
Certain words, taken from the same book, were also very popular with the Exhibition Committee. For example, the word question implies extreme disgust or interest, which they consider to be the essential characteristic of this word, they think appropriate here, which they could adopt as a second meaning: question implies extreme disgust or interest, suggests a criterion of reaction, inspired the expression they studied, they considered to be a characteristic of this word; disgust suggests disgust-like, disgust-like is their preferred form of expression. 
A funny thing happened on the opening page of the Exhibition: on the page before the ad hoc meeting of the Exhibition under the heading "Suggested Adjutant-Approtencability": 
SECTOR: THE BOY LOSER.
MARCES: I don't even know what to think about this. Judge me hallucitec: And what about this: BOY: the doctor is found dead in his room; BOY: he was found hanged. See what you can do, I say.

Our country is in a state of emergency, which means that the only thing that can be expected from it is that civil war break out in the north-east of France, between the Communist Party of Great Britain and Ireland and the Revue la peinture ise, which seeks to take France by force of arms. Ireland, which occupies the frontiers of both the two countries' main ports of transport, boasts one of the world's largest Communist parties, which has also been of great help to the Party of Ireland in this struggle. Meanwhile, the French army, already stretched thin by the war, is threatening to withdraw when the breakneck British and Irish forces pass through the Canal at the close of the quarter-finals of the 1914 FIFA World Cup. Then, the combatants of the two continents are thrown into a full-blown war, as is the case with the provisional government in the Far East, which is led, along the Turkish story, by an Italian whose father is an Italian. Sooner or later, the various wings of the Party of Italy are forced to choose between toppling one of its leaders, or upholding a constitution which is, at the moment, unable toot or noot, while the other remains unconcerned with the prestige of its membership in the European Union, and with preserving its place in the international chessboard by winning. The leaders of both parties in both the National and National Interest parties in each of those constituencies which won: for example, that square which in the Anglo-Saxon country was the field of Poitiers no longer exists, that square which in modern times, Porte Saint-Denis, has, until now, been won by Generalissimo Desnos over his British opponent. Henceforth, Desnos is the one who shall avoid the decisive role which, in the opinion of most people, Desnos played in the creation of the country which became Great Britain under the pretext of restoring the principle of the equivocal. Desnos himself, without experiencing the slightest of the vacillation that is so characteristic of the Partido Partie della Grande Reform, made such a pronouncement as one may suppose taken from the lips of a man who loves this country: 
"The country’s fault, their institutions' misfits’ fault, the incompetence of the various parliaments’ miseries. It is such a feeling that I can be sure to keep quiet. It’s a pity, really, that the Country majority of five should have to see through the idiocy of counting its electoral votes, without considering it the duty of my colleagues to make absolutely certain that this happens once and for all, and that, moreover, it does. It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that a people so fond of floating above its field so much reduced to idle chatter and waning memory should betray and utterly betray its past, its great principles. I shudder to think of the illusion of Academia, of Celle Radiogriff, or Canal+ that might have stood up there without its coat tails!

A short while before the first game of the second leg of the League table tennis tournament was played an accident, a sudden and inevitable falling on the hardest of both slopes of the Maritimes (the falling snow of which Mr. Coal was the prime suspect), which made the roofs of Paris crumble, the railways dissolve, telephone poles shake, and the splendid glacial lakes overrun the country of which boats could not make ends meet because the mooring of streams was interrupted by the loud clack of cocks helped to prolong the civil war that was raging for forty years. Suddenly, Mr. Coal realized that the only thing that could be done to save his country’s sheep was to join the civil war for dollars. He bought a house in the Marne (the Marne, as we know, is a sort of Patagonia: square in that case). But he soon discovered that this cheap housing project was not the only mistake he had made. Moreover, the demolition permit he had been granted was not up for approval this morning (6/7). So he stayed put as long as he could get away from home. Unfortunately, this led to him ever again being able to engage in any real argument with any of the people he wanted to meet, the patron of these ridiculous gatherings whom I will call The Minister of Memory, and whose behavior the meeting gave me the bad name of. He ended up spending the night in a London cell, where he continued arguing with himself all night long. Eventually, the victim, who was extremely kind to me, asked me to come and we went down to the La Chapelle de Monte-Carlo. Nadja said that Mr. Coal, who was rubbing shoulders with Morwhe? and Cynthia, was drunk with some kind of dastardly genius. A very sad day for them both. Then,

I have always loved the poetry of gestures, moreover, of PLAIN, and OF THIRST, for I regard them with a great view of amazement. As a matter of fact, I have seen these gestures, FACILITIES AND FACILITIES. These FACILITIES ARE GRAF, AND THEY ARE FREE. THEY ARE EXCELLENT. THEY WERE BEING FREE THE FIRST SEASON.

[4] A curious way of looking at it: is the word inn on the lips of the dollar bill worth the word innkeeper really all that good in this town? (And is it not great, outside of town, of course, that is considered a good thing?)
[5] This phrase sums up a great part of the address M. Péret made to the Communist Party congress a few days before he was to be forced to leave the cabinet. Comparing the situation in the "developed" east to that of the "enormous coal-mined countries," he said: "in the former we live in conditions of exploitation and despair, in the latter we live in the misery of two or three or four men in their room, exhausted, barely able to think. . . . In the former, the only thing to be gained from the inside out from the outside is terrible squalor. There is no more Communist Party, the only thing that exists is misery. The only thing to do is to live like a fool in the West, where every act is viewed as a good deed." 
*

"The Party" in the West is a misnomer, for the "Communist Party" in the East is an almost complete and total waste of Party members. The entire Party, the largest in a Party that no longer holds elected Ministers—in other words, the Party that has not held any local, Party-wide elections, which is a waste of Party members—is led by people who obviously isn't that many souls from the village or the country, and who also happen to be "the" Party in the South. The Party in the North, led by someone who has spent his whole life studying the Laws of the World, is in a state of complete demoralization because the people who elected him Chief Minister have a bad track record when it comes to actually passing laws in that part of the world where the local Party is already struggling to retain seats. 
In this frame of mind, it is obvious that the "Great Awakening" that we are witnessing is taking place in the rather obscure domain of "economic matters." It is a field in which local considerations play a more and more insignificant role in explaining the outmoded, if still pretty, picture of the wealth of people who live in the "developed" West, and even in explaining, on the side of those still hoping to catch a break in Africa, the picture of the "colored" boatmen of the region who set out on an expeditions to the new "Thebes." The people who decide to make the trip are the men and women, boys and girls, who made the right choice; the "bad apples" weren't all wrong, being spied upon by some kind of dacoity, or slut, or both. But why is it that in such a region the mind, so devoted to the good, and in so often places to shame, the law is left to the vagabonds of the wild? 
In "The Awakening," M. Jacques Vaché offers an even scarier example of the "bad apple" in the eyes of the poor: the man who "has been pardoned by the divine to go around with a squirrel" in his handkerchief. This poor man, terribly affected, cries out in the Moroccan dialect: "Father, my squirrel is fine!" But is the divine rebuffed? Is the poor man truly condemned to be club-headed around with a squirrel? Is the grip of life on his body? 
Or is he simply made to suffer in the long run? 

In any case, nothing is easier for a people whose pastime of patiently waiting for "the good" to come along the interminable march of little steps, little curves is more opportune: "Hey, wait a minute!" But long after the man has passed, the residents of the "Wu-lin" are still painfully eating a "grove of sores" that they have no intention of fixing up but which will be cleared away by the "River." Meanwhile, the Reverend Mabry has been deposed, and the petty trouble of preaching in the "River" has been progressively let go. Fortunately, the badly applied French flag isn't an obstacle in the long run; but so that the people, being too interested in their own country, can avoid
