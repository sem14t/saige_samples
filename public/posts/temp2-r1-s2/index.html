    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the story of the poet or of the poet who had so kindly lent his time and his talents to writing a hymn, a poem, which he passed on to his friends, even though their memory would have endorsed it. Poets always had a right to lend their time, even to lend their talents, but not to lend money. The most outstanding part of the past few months, the news of the arrest of a poet in the Armenian community, the surprise made by an order of a guild in the Swedish jurists, the abrogation of letters sent by my friend and intellectual collaborator Jarry to Philippe Soupault's house in Paris, all this compounded my griefs sorrow over the atrociousness of the facts, and the profound sincerity of the words which emerged from their mouths. My friends, you have no business in the country.
You are the savages of Italic lands, the savages of the poet who has inspired so many poets. You are still the savages of the Middle Ages. You are the savages of the Middle Ages. And what can we do to end this abominable abominableness? boards, viola, harp, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, viola, we have nothing against them, but they are the savages of the Middle Ages, the savages of the poem, the savages of Dante, of A.R.R.S. (Art of the Rich), and of Shelley. We have nothing against the bad taste of poets, but we must remember that we are all savages. And that we are the savages of the Good Lord. Shelley, who studied at the School of Gothic at the age of fifteen, and A.R.R.S at the School of Performing Arts at the age of fifteen, had a marvelous genius that quickly withered when she saw that she was writing, and she had a talent for bad writing that left her no choice but to restore her by means of recipes and examples. The author of sad stories and those who prefers to remember her to a days life, Breton, who was a consumptive, Lefebvre, who made wine, and so on. The end of the world has at its disposal a consumptive who can then be considered a palatinate, who can then easily substitute plaster for an enamel tongue. The author of charming stories, for whom the capacity to write at the level of a short storybook has not been attempted and, in fact, has not been attempted, would be a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, Father Christmas.</p>
<p>I have tried to be as objective as possible in my criticism of the poetic methods of Baudelaire and of Max Ernst. I have even taken a more active part in this process of revisionism, in the harshest of all arrests of the critical life by means of literary critics. My general criticism is of the pure, my conclusions the consequences of which I will speak. My particular attention is to those works, even if I admit that they are sometimes, in my opinion, less vulgar than others, in my judgment, but still still still considered in the vulgar tradition. I do not consider them to be poetry at all. I consider them to be poetry in a sense limited by the term poetry to a specific form of expression, which is what the expression really is, and which is what the concrete form of expression on the one hand, and the collective expression of expression on the other, is, but is not the only difference, or the difference only in the dialective sense, of the poetic form, I mean the dialectical expression in the sense I have given it here. I do not consider them to be poetry in the strict sense that is still given to me, but in the sense that I have in mind when I speak of them.
No matter what happens with the theory of the concrete form, the concrete form must always be concerned, above all, with the contradiction of ideas, and poetry does not replace logic. The concrete form is concerned with the concrete process, and it is this contradiction of ideas, called the concrete form, which I refer to in this book, and which I believe I have finally cleared up. It is this concrete form, the concrete image which I refer to in this book, which is responsible for the various forms which I have described here, and which I believe I have finally cleared up.
The concrete form is the idea, the concrete image which I have described here. It is this concrete image, I believe, which is responsible for the appearance of particular things, of certain men, and it is this very idea, rather, which I refer to in this book, in the very near future in a veritable book-smile, to make sure of the survival of the human spirit, and to give voice to certain absurd and enigmatic ideas</p>
