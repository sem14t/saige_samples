    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved the poetry of gestures, moreover, of PLAIN, and OF THIRST, for I regard them with a great view of amazement. As a matter of fact, I have seen these gestures, FACILITIES AND FACILITIES. These FACILITIES ARE GRAF, AND THEY ARE FREE. THEY ARE EXCELLENT. THEY WERE BEING FREE THE FIRST SEASON.</p>
<p>[1] G. MacMillan, Armand Breton.[2] ‘The Restaurant Grévain?], p. 45.[3]
[4] A curious way of looking at it: is the word inn on the lips of the dollar bill worth the word innkeeper really all that good in this town? (And is it not great, outside of town, of course, that is considered a good thing?)
[5] This phrase sums up a great part of the address M. Péret made to the Communist Party congress a few days before he was to be forced to leave the cabinet. Comparing the situation in the &ldquo;developed&rdquo; east to that of the &ldquo;enormous coal-mined countries,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;in the former we live in conditions of exploitation and despair, in the latter we live in the misery of two or three or four men in their room, exhausted, barely able to think. . . . In the former, the only thing to be gained from the inside out from the outside is terrible squalor. There is no more Communist Party, the only thing that exists is misery. The only thing to do is to live like a fool in the West, where every act is viewed as a good deed.&rdquo;
*</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Party&rdquo; in the West is a misnomer, for the &ldquo;Communist Party&rdquo; in the East is an almost complete and total waste of Party members. The entire Party, the largest in a Party that no longer holds elected Ministers—in other words, the Party that has not held any local, Party-wide elections, which is a waste of Party members—is led by people who obviously isn't that many souls from the village or the country, and who also happen to be &ldquo;the&rdquo; Party in the South. The Party in the North, led by someone who has spent his whole life studying the Laws of the World, is in a state of complete demoralization because the people who elected him Chief Minister have a bad track record when it comes to actually passing laws in that part of the world where the local Party is already struggling to retain seats.
In this frame of mind, it is obvious that the &ldquo;Great Awakening&rdquo; that we are witnessing is taking place in the rather obscure domain of &ldquo;economic matters.&rdquo; It is a field in which local considerations play a more and more insignificant role in explaining the outmoded, if still pretty, picture of the wealth of people who live in the &ldquo;developed&rdquo; West, and even in explaining, on the side of those still hoping to catch a break in Africa, the picture of the &ldquo;colored&rdquo; boatmen of the region who set out on an expeditions to the new &ldquo;Thebes.&rdquo; The people who decide to make the trip are the men and women, boys and girls, who made the right choice; the &ldquo;bad apples&rdquo; weren't all wrong, being spied upon by some kind of dacoity, or slut, or both. But why is it that in such a region the mind, so devoted to the good, and in so often places to shame, the law is left to the vagabonds of the wild?
In &ldquo;The Awakening,&rdquo; M. Jacques Vaché offers an even scarier example of the &ldquo;bad apple&rdquo; in the eyes of the poor: the man who &ldquo;has been pardoned by the divine to go around with a squirrel&rdquo; in his handkerchief. This poor man, terribly affected, cries out in the Moroccan dialect: &ldquo;Father, my squirrel is fine!&rdquo; But is the divine rebuffed? Is the poor man truly condemned to be club-headed around with a squirrel? Is the grip of life on his body?
Or is he simply made to suffer in the long run?</p>
<p>In any case, nothing is easier for a people whose pastime of patiently waiting for &ldquo;the good&rdquo; to come along the interminable march of little steps, little curves is more opportune: &ldquo;Hey, wait a minute!&rdquo; But long after the man has passed, the residents of the &ldquo;Wu-lin&rdquo; are still painfully eating a &ldquo;grove of sores&rdquo; that they have no intention of fixing up but which will be cleared away by the &ldquo;River.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the Reverend Mabry has been deposed, and the petty trouble of preaching in the &ldquo;River&rdquo; has been progressively let go. Fortunately, the badly applied French flag isn't an obstacle in the long run; but so that the people, being too interested in their own country, can avoid</p>
