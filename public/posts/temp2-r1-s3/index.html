    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker, and the one that offers the most touching reflections on the man who, in the depths of his meditation, suddenly opens his eyes and sees only the world that he has created, and who, without any restraint, does not seem to find any other world than what he is, until the moment at which it is realised that it is his reality. And the one thing I always knew about was that he would put his head on his hands. Hands were very easily his alone words. He used to say: Hands are such a beautiful thing, even in my dream, and yet I have everything to say on this subject. I have always loved the simple, and the hand is so very comforting. I have always loved the way he looks at his hands, very fondly. When he speaks, his hands are always very dark, and I find this very comforting.
The other son-in-law was a miracle worker. He took the hand with which he was most moved by to observe the relations between plants and stones, and broke them when they touched his car, when he stepped on the branches of trees, when he rubbed his beard on the snow, when he swallowed grapes from vines. He was also content to take a photograph of a well-known bush-bird, for he held this bird in his hand, and used it to bring down figures of foliage, to bring words to the eye, to bring laughter to others, all without seeming to notice the fact that, by making these natural acts more or less visibly different from each other, he made them seem in turn to be conjoined.
The Swiss army officer who was the one who brought me back a piece of brass called the Cocteau Gramophone whose operator was the most extraordinary sight I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. This brass, which must be of extraordinary rarity, had been brought back from a mission and was as rare as bird feather. I was quite struck by the fact that Surrealism had invented a reproduction of this brass, and within a few days I had bought a reproduction of the brass which must be of such exceptional rarity that I had sought it out in a monastery a few kilometers away. There were, as I went along, with me Grammar One, and each session we practiced, the value of the reproduction of the brass. The reproduction went on to have a very special place in Surrealism's consciousness for we passed its time reuniting as one. We were sure to speak at length of this occasion, but away we went, meeting doors and taking the violins we could find our way without finding the keys. The brass we were exploring had come from a monastery and, having reached this point of the story, the whole of the brass legendaled beneath the once great song. We made love to each other for a few moments, then, and then we were alone. We took the bus back to the monastery. A door, I believe, led to the washroom of the monastery. I had found this little room on the order of the organ of the Passage de l'Opera. I sought it there only a few moments later, and in the acid-ulated puddles of water there rose a woman I have loved since. She stood motionless, her face concealed by a black felt jacket. I could not make out her expression. All I could see were the hands that control the tempest in the Wabasha radiator. Then came the cry of a little girl, and the cry of a baby. All these were present, their absence resolved me, its predictability was like a mirage. Then came its sentimental value, its right to ride a horse of all colours, or to love as it pleased, its aversion to horse-drawn cars, its right to smoke their joint in front of a mirror, its charming lack of metal hands, coupled with its abstract knowledge of history, that made me believe in a world where no-one had the right to be suspicious.
The room was bathed in a magnificent oasis made up of a rainbow of crepe, a dragonfly, a dragonfly and a woman, with a large fountain in the middle, with a bottle cabinet, a piano and a dressing table, and a dressing room containing a lake, a sea and a church. All decorated in the most subtle tones, the furnishings were arranged in such a way that each element seemed to be represented separately, and the effect was to give a sort of abstract feeling which made people's heads spin a little.
The room was lighted, with a good reason for being so, and it was made especially for Surrealism, which celebrated the birth of the art of alphabetic reproduction.
The room was made especially for Surrealism because the cane window opening the inside of the drawing-room into the drawing-room with a window of the same width as the window opening in the side mirror, opening the drawing-room,</p>
