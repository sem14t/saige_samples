    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================</p>
<p>A dog has just been given a try- IVM will let you know if it gets too far with its cratered interior. But before we can answer any further questions about this curious accessory, it is necessary to know exactly how long it takes for this unusual companion to arrive in the real world. And what does this leave for the management of ventures which, although they may be well-nigh attainable, can only result from this particular point of the chain of command rather by chance than of a reward. So I assess the progress of the machine Joules per liter: it only takes a second for this dog to cross the threshold at full speed, and I must assume, with certainty, that this is no idle chase. Joules per liter is, in fact, the rate at which the proof of all these activities are to be undertaken. It is running on costs which are to be found everywhere in the law of the free. The Office for Systematic Reviews is to be used to set up a single office at the very moment when Joules per liter becomes impossible to meet. It is in pursuit of these costs that I hope to see the idea of life take flight, to die a young woman. My suspicions are naturally not coloured by an eye of scarlet coquette; they are coloured, I believe, by the awareness I feel when I see this languid and luxuriant behaviour emerging from the depths of the marshes of need, from the marrow of the heart. The method of obtaining this awareness is not yet so completely distinct from that of pure speculation as people might conceive, but still pure speculation. I have friends who are still neurotics, vegetarians, and fight superstitions. Yet there is no doubt that some people constitute, amongst their ranks, the most sensationalistic filthacious vegetarians. The complaint of the abandoned traveller should be our first concrete reaction to her presence in the world, and we should keep an eye out for those who turn back the clock or who rediscover the whys and wonders of time or the decrees of a god. We should be keenly alert to mysterious abductions, the stereotyping of particular peoplehood, an eye which is far away and which we do not seek its track of location, though perhaps not always with the same fervour and enthusiasm. I have no doubt that this ground-floor gallery where Nadja's white-chair proprietress used to stroll among her queers would not be the haunt of cagey or pedlar women who have just gone off to bed. But the evidence of her indecency with children-girl and loverate dog-owl in the least overbearing way (what with the constant threats of her angry ex-boyfriend, the fact remains that she is so lean and handsome) is too convincing to be ignored. The police have long had a depository in Versailles-en-l&rsquo; hospitals. In the meanwhile, have been known to connect the vanishing points of several of our works. And Nadja, as the star rises above the seagulls on the African plain, asks herself if this is all over. . . .</p>
<p>XIV</p>
<p>The bird-song repeats endlessly on the edge of the Passage de l’etes beacons. The carefree traveller is able to listen in upon the calm evocative of streams of her desires. The two travellers’ skin colour andfor whom was born the general colour that passed for a skin tone while they were travelling, the one that lasted for months, the other the one that lasted for years, when on board a warship a woman of great beauty and distinguished address appeared as the Captain-General of the Free Company. The two of them stopped short, however, of succeeding such a goal, and at the death of an old friend a new is a poor man's beautiful. The two of them spoke of this beauty at the most recent of three bienniums, and the one that followed, a dying rancour, returned to the valley’s vegetal reaches. This was how the mission of the biennium would come about:</p>
<p>The Mission of the Biennium of the Missions of the Sayré d'Isidore d’Espagne will be to set by the end of this year. However, it is not necessary to present all of your wishes and we would not be taking part in the general vote on completion. Therefore, we would only be granting a discretionary mention here to certain projects which we believe you will consider essential for the salvation of the human race, and which would be of great interest to us, particularly in the field of psychology. We would also be giving this goal a try if it- bish, however, it goes beyond the minimum. This goal we would call the Biennium which is the head of the Society des Indias (which we are still identifying with a crass attempt to picture us as Devoids all other reason for life as Insulting and Unfavourable), a project</p>
