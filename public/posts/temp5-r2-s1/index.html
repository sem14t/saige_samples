    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================</p>
<p>The man with the long beard was standing at the entrance of the café. He made a mental note to get to the back of the building.
The man with the long beard was sitting at the far end of the sidewalk. He spoke:
&ldquo;I have a gig, I swear. I'll have a meal out of this here. Five francs and ten florins is a good meal for a boy.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And if you want to go and have a drink, then I'll take off my green veil hat and gold-trimmed shirt. I'll take off my hat and shirt too, baby.&rdquo;
The man with the long beard was drinking cup after cup of coffee too. He spoke with a knowing gaze. The crowd came to a boil. The dirty taximan got up quickly. Behind him came the woman with the long beard. Behind her, the little slut got up little by little. She studied the world. Each moment of her waking made her feel small and small. But the moment she sat down next to someone in the world of cupcakes, she would stand thirty-four inches of height and make a wobbly cup. And her breasts, they would name them. And, because they slept so flat, they would all be of a small shape.
When she was sure, she would follow that of the little toads to the right and left, following the one below, and, following the one below, she would press her pinkie against her belly. But she knew that, under all the noise, every so often, she would find myself restraining my perfume, that perfume that smelled of sobs, of sobs that ruined her sleep.
And her bust, a joy to behold, was as shiny and blue as the sky. Her tits, a pain to forget, were as hard as rock bottomes. And because they squeezed so well, they gave off a thick, strong smell.
She had to be squeezed. And squeezed so hard.
She did this several times. Each time in a hurry, she picked up and threw away a piece of the furniture that held the drapes. But the smell kept coming, and the knotting and the knotting again. A simple beat of the kneaded cloth, a perfume was born.
A perfume that smelled of sobs, of sobs.
And the man without a beard, eyes wide open, looked at her with a smile. Was he alone in his terror at the sight of his bust covered with a perfume?
The crowd gathered around the café came back one by one in full force, foot in and foot out. Some continued to lift their skirts in the homage. Others bit the dust off their jackets and headed off to the left. At the end, once the turnstiles had crossed the street, all dressed up, went to meet a house couple. They would meet this way: their way was a little rougher than the other. Their skirts would be swept up in a garroted car and, after which they would stroll down the boulevards in a great pelted and muzzled motorcycle, their clothes and valise one by one getting faster and faster. The stranger awaited their destination. In a few days they would be at the hairdresser's. They would go as far as buying bicycles. And they would buy perfume.
The road to fortune was long and narrow. The potter had left a widow's head on the pinnacle of his throne. The angels had given their blessing to his miseries. The fogs of youth had veiled their beauties in good times and in evil. But the angels had not favoured them with their promised promises. In their hands the four winds had hung a cup of fire.
The cup of fire had held promise to the drapery. But all the flies had closed up shop and taken their places once more around the globe. The beans of chance had died a long dark and the mire. The flies had fledce and gone on to war. The beans of chance had declined in size and flown away to fight with the stars. But the flies had kept their distance. They were not cowards. They had not forgotten the charm of the stars on the heaven of the hams. In their glaucous exile, the flies had given birth to a man who stood to reason and a widow who would soon no longer be afraid in her bedroom. She was about to wake up on Saturday morning.
On the door was written the following:</p>
<p>THE FLIP-HOP MANIFESTO TO BE FOUND</p>
<p>THE FLIP-HOP MANIFESTO</p>
<p>THE FLIP-HOP MANIFESTO</p>
<p>THE FLIP-HOP MANIFESTO</p>
