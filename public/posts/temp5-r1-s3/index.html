    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 3 ========================================</p>
<p>The second of the three episodes of the &ldquo;Veil of the Republic,&rdquo; in which Surrealism succeeds in ridding the world of it, &ldquo;Veil of the Republic&rdquo; is as dead as its first movie, in which the moral as well as the practical importance of liberty is taught. In this terrible historical drama, which succeeds only in giving the impression of an intellectual history, &ldquo;Prisoners of the World&rdquo; loses without real cause a great number of qualities that make it different from the others. It is easy to detest this film as poorly as it does. It is true that the basic idea of the historical period is quite simply that of man's escape from nature: these two animals whose lives have been separated by movements of the mind. But the allegorical characterizations of the period are quite appropriate for a sentimental and historical film, and as durable as a scientific film. And certainly the Prisoners of the World is not a proof of any real historical genius, but a fine example of how to use them in a film, and also of the instinct of the director to keep them secret.</p>
<p>The second of these mediocre films, from the group that is just as bad as the first, is a pathetic homage to eighteenth-century poetry. The cinematography is mediocre, the dialogue mediocre, the set pieces mediocre, the cinematographic style mediocre — and in this respect the film does not disappoint. A few good jokes and a fine performance by Uwe Turettin.[3] What is really bad about the first film is that it lacked the spirit of the present; it lacked the spirit of the first. It lacked both. It lacked the spirit of the operas. It also lacked the spirit of historical historical historical historical historical which is exactly what the two historical films lacked: a historical film in that it is a film on the reigns of Bonapartist monarchs, and a historical film in that it is a historical film on the fall of the Berlin Wall, both of which the characters on whose behalf they depend for salvation are doomed to fail.
I have often cited these two historical films, the one about the Revolution and the other about Nietzsche and the Second Republic, to the great number of peoples who have turned to these two films, and I have to say that these two films are no less mediocre than the first, and in the end I can say that they both failed in me. Because I loved them, I abandoned Nietzsche and the Second Republic to the same fate. I could in good conscience not re-live these films, and still retain them, but I have avoided them, having rather late ceased doing so. At the age of fifteen, I renounced almost all respectability to the rank stupidity of Machiavelli, and in doing this I lost out on the unreal spectacle of Baudelaire, which made me a less and less real man. I renounced almost everything except the audacity of Iggy, except the naiveté of Jacques Vaché, and even so, on the contrary, did I spend my life renouncing.
Between these two extremes, when I was about to close up shop in Paris, a charming little shop appeared on the cobblestones, a little girl with a face like a blossoming plum: it was covered with a simple T-work of faded silk and, when a blonde woman came into the room, I could tell by the sparkling of eyes, the tiny shopgirl, was in fact quite as innocent as the curtain-raiser in the other room, as innocent as the late show bed, as innocent as the electric mirror, as late as the theater bed, as late as the theater bed, as late as the electric mirror, and as late as the bed, where, as though on cue, a rat appeared to the mother rat of the monotonous lesson. A little rat. Well, that little rat, she wasn't supposed to appear suddenly to be a little rat. It was enough to make the evening stir in the dark, this rat with a wicked look in its eyes, a rat whose appearance caught my attention. I raised my gaze toward the shop girl, and noticed immediately that her long brown hair was tangled in her negligee, and that, instead of continuing to wither in the light, it was curled up in a ball on the bed. This was because, before sitting down, the little rat had lain still on the bed, while its mother rat played with itself in the corner of the room, waiting to burst with a violent bang.
The shop girl, sitting up, called out to the little rat whose father was here:
&hellip;the little rat, the rat with the hair on its head, was very affectionate to me. I repeated my command several times, and it still isn't satisfied. I put my hand on its shoulder and lean my head toward its bed, kiss its neck, as if to whisper some little secret to it. When the sleeper comes toward daylight, I lean my</p>
