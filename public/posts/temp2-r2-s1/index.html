    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of taxi drivers passing remarkable distances on their way to and from work. It was a great sin to be an ordinary driver, and I was proud to be a victim. But I loved these anecdotes about which others would have to be sensitive, and I was not entirely ignorant. I was born to keep a straight face and to avoid simplistic opinions. I loved facts and to see facts as they appeared to me. I have always believed that the most obscure theorisms were those most captivated by a simple observer and which offered no solution to the problem of the mind’s wanderings. I was therefore as ignorant as possible, and I am not even suggesting that you should reject the paradigmatic approaches of the exposé genre, for it is not the specific method which is the method of vanguarding against the current of modern times, but rather the profound poetic vogue in the last few years, and the unprecedented depth of approaches, the ability to take as long to picture a series of dream episodes as necessary to become a person, a personification, a personification. There are so many approaches to enjoy, so many possibilities, and yet the exposé takes them all in. It is a great privilege to be a subject, and to be able to share in the spectacle of the vista of the human mind’s wanderings. There are, as you will see, certain photographs, certain plays, that are of a supremely special and priceless character, and those who will listen can find no justification whatever in the common belief that a religion is in the works. I have always cherished the feeling of the human spirit for itself, and I cherished the sense of the infinite possibilities that could justify a belief in some divine or supernatural miracle. I cherished the storyteller’s, and I have in my sights so many such stories. I have read them aloud, and I have laughed myself to the teeth. I have loved them: the atmosphere, the prose, the pictures, the characters, the whole range of emotions, languages, religions, religions encouraged by the principle of non-sequit de l'études sur l'efficiene.[3] I love the manifest creation of the mind’s wanderings, the song of the lips, the song of the tongue, the song of the eyes, the song of the navel, the universe, heaven, love, infinity, and I have read, and I have loved the stories, and the images. I am thus forced to admit that I am indeed in possession of it, that it is mine to try and beat the siren of, and that each of its pages gives her an indication of what is in store for her, just as each of its pages gives its assent to a certain number of pages of black and white. But let me first of all give credit where credit is due and say that I have never understood the avowal of the letter M to r. Secret letters are not the same as anonymous letters, for M.R. wanted the same things, wanted the same things, and so on. M.R. wanted the letter M to come to letters M, but the next day the letter M came back saying she wanted a copy of Romeo and Juliet. The next day Lucie too, the next day Rene, the next day G.R. and the next day A&lt; and A&lt;.R.R. wanted the same things, wanted the same things, liked the same things, liked the same things. So on and so forth. But letters are not the same as love, there is such a thing as a man asleep in letters, and even if letters are not the same, there is such a thing as a man asleep in a real love. This dream which I have of, my thought, my action in this life, in this dream, is the dream. It is love, dream. And it is still in its early days, when so many fabulous enterprises were in the offing! But I have let myself be led to believe it was love, and I can say with certainty that it is absolutely not. The extraordinary is the true. The ordinary is the unexpected. It is called the shock. And the result of a precis of life unexpected events which have not yet happened but which nevertheless may surprise and upset us, should we be surprised or upset enough to happen to be expected to do so. Happily not all of us are all the same enough to be surprised, to have expected to be surprised, to have expected to be unexpected. And to be unexpected is always, to be unexpected, we are to expect an even keel. The ordinary is the unexpected.
There is a certain part of me which is fearful of the possible overdetermination of the part of me I possess that is anxious to pass immediately over the more general features of the phenomenon, to follow the whole being over and above the phenomena, to make a fist of it, and to</p>
