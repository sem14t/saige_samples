    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================</p>
<p>We find ourselves on the quay the scene of one of those legendary cathedrals not often found in the world: the Senegalese, it may be, but the urbanaeous has never offered anything new, anything that might be termed a formal ally. In the reign of the Villa Franca, for instance, there existed a man who could hoist a Carpathian curve across the Atlantic, cross the Solomon Islands. And yet, after the exile in the U.S.A., the Villa Franca offered nothing unusual to the succession of monarchs, and it was not at the top of the first steps of the Palais Royal that I met the man most at the time considered a true renegade. He was absolutely chic, in black and silver with a gray suit, in a cool, ill-fitting suit, a black shirt barely running the length of the hips, and with no hat but a light gray suit with a white top and hat decorated with fish. He was looking at a black invective printed on his belt, something like this a good month ago:
BLESSINGS</p>
<p>I would make you bleed over the rooftops.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.</p>
<p>That, my friends, is the name of the steeple bell.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The precipice rises to the sea</p>
<p>The virgin that bars herself from the sea</p>
<p>Took the liberty of dying</p>
<p>In the sea</p>
<p>The virgin that bars herself from the sea</p>
<p>Was unknown at the time</p>
<p>Yet already a prey to sudden considerations</p>
<p>She is the bustle of the city walls</p>
<p>The city of distress heads leave the streets</p>
<p>The city walls are under house arrest</p>
<p>The city walls are under house arrest</p>
<p>So that everyone who comes here can easily be led one way</p>
<p>There there is more to be learned</p>
<p>Less still nearer the fold</p>
<p>Like a garden of tears blooming beside your city</p>
<p>Like a tragic shade in a park of senseless flowers</p>
<p>Like senselessness in a purer shade</p>
<p>Like a caress that is both soothing and hypocritical</p>
<p>Like the solitary repose I know well</p>
<p>Like the calm that one is incapable of experiencing in another</p>
<p>Like the natural calm one can be anywhere in the world</p>
<p>Like the enchantment one can be felt anywhere</p>
<p>Like the mystery one must answer to earn one’s own living</p>
<p>Like the revenge one must take for granted a sword that will make him fly or swim</p>
<p>Like the boredom of thought that is an empty word that makes one sick and makes you lean your head back a while</p>
<p>Like the marvelous intoxication of feeling that is the flow of one thought</p>
<p>Like the exaltation one must do these feelings which intoxicate</p>
<p>The flow of one thought</p>
<p>To visualize them in this way</p>
<p>With the example of a swing of the panes and chairs</p>
<p>Making one dizzy and sickly in the process of organizing them</p>
<p>Another way of looking the intoxication of looking</p>
<p>That goes along with being human</p>
<p>Like a torrent which resembles the vine</p>
<p>Still another way of approaching the subject at hand</p>
<p>With the example of a sudden and terrible vine</p>
<p>With one’s hood which one crosses</p>
<p>One gains of one endows a whole army of dews</p>
<p>With their colors and their faces changeable by the heat of the sun</p>
<p>With their hands like smoke trails</p>
<p>With their gestures like barbarism and their ways like disorder</p>
<p>One must overcome all this to become human</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>SOLUBLE FISH</p>
<p>The garden of fish</p>
<p>When everything is green</p>
<p>When everything is green</p>
<p>The girl with the tunic</p>
<p>Swings from side to side with each of her arms</p>
<p>When she sees the fish flutter</p>
<p>When she closely examines the tunic</p>
<p>She learns</p>
<p>How to fish without fins</p>
<p>Without a hat</p>
<p>Without a head</p>
<p>And with a mind that is like &ldquo;fish-fish&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>MODES OF THE GENTLE-HON work themselves into the solid earth</p>
<p>But under a curve of green</p>
<p>Not quite straight up and down</p>
<p>The garter horse with all the teeth</p>
<p>With all the milkhorse blood flowing to the pedum</p>
<p>And the flamingwheels</p>
<p>That impenetrable mind</p>
<p>That knows no other kings feet like rams</p>
<p>That over and over again</p>
<p>There is a siren’s voice saying to the trees</p>
<p>There is water under the curve of green</p>
<p>There are stars</p>
<p>The curve of green</p>
<p>Can one say there are stars</p>
<p>There are no blue skies</p>
<p>No clouds under the curve of green</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>MODES OF THE GREECE ARE AQUAVER</p>
<p>Aquatic wind</p>
<p>Astronomical phenomenon</p>
<p>Astronomical phenomenon</p>
<p>Astronomical phenomenon</p>
<p>The blue sky of the house of Venus</p>
<p>The blue sky of the house of Venus</p>
<p>Aquatic wind</p>
