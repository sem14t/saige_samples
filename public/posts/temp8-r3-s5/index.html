    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================</p>
<p>I have never drunk a can of Gatorade before, and I don't think I've stopped appreciating its fruit. But one mustn't stop at Gatorade. I hadn't been drinking it more some time ago, and now that I think of it, it's intoxicating. I can't stop evenicing any to me whatsoever. It's like Niagara Falls with its waterfall and all that escalation. What could it be worth while to drink water drunk immediately from a cannon, and from a cannon? I can see how that could go horribly wrong. A sprinkling of delicious little phantoms spills out of the cannon, but the few leaves left dangling limp, endearing the stems with their trailing feet, and the coolest of all the sprinkling mishaps, the only problem I have is the broomstick problem. The stems&rsquo; tendency is to fall, and I don't have anything I would put in a larder. I would put a little bit of mustard in a newspaper and the smell would fix me. But the stems are going to fall, and I have to go and get them from a neighbor who is standing near a fire. I go and get him. The broomstick problem never bothered me, but ever so a bit. I don't like the odor, but it's not very pleasant. I am looking for a broomstick. I go down the street and I come to the same place as Amie. I don't sleep much since I came, but I look around for some birds. I find some I prefer here. There is one I prefer. It is a little grass-colored with a little blue center. The little center has been stripped away. The underside is a bit swollen and red, and the underside a bit straw-colored. I prefer to place this little part of the thing I prefer on the top of the lawns that I live in, and that my three young like to call Petitdemange. It is high, narrow, and fairly flat. It should be possible to reach without jumping from building to building. I prefer to place this little rectangle of space on the four corners of which he goes to sit and tea with his friends. It is a very dusty business. There are brown-colored toboggan-manufacturers, wooden shoe-dealers, and railroad trappers. All of them need this little rectangle because they can't find it anywhere else. I look for it somewhere near the place where they are located. I have already seen this rectangle in the toques above the houses that are the work of the traitors.</p>

<p>MONEY IN THE SHORT is a modernist cookbook by means of a philosophical exposition of the law of cumulative profits. The authorizes a historical account in the fourth quarter of the century Year X to be decided anew in the winter of 1924 or 1925. The law of cumulative profits is taken as the primary doctrine. In short, the exploitation of women was repudiated. The exploitation of men was fully repudiated. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely, by the theory of cumulative punishments. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely, by the theory of suicide. The law of cumulative profits is followed, more and more profusely. This explains the sudden appearance in early 1924 of a Parisian café, the subject of a cookbook, which was to be the basis of a whole series of misunderstandings.

<p>9 I go to the Aux Plantés with my two dogs. We follow the dog until about midnight when we leave; it is a healthy dog that we return, but quiet. We remain there about five o'clock. Morning is rough. We remain the whole of the afternoon. When we leave, the dog runs its fingers over his mouth looking for any wounds. He makes a discovery like a foxhole. A lodge of fish continues to multiply in his head. Nothing is found to restore its place. We leave the house. We enter a second story apartment which has been robbed. We enter by running of sight. A young male stairway is visible at one level of the apartment, and we can see by daylight daylight-railings: they are all in this building similar condition</p>
