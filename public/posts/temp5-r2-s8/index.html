    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the world’s poor servants are not the only ones to lean on the spigot of their assumption.
It is in fact quite clear that the factors who precipitate the various movements of the earth’s crust are not the only ones to go up and down, either mechanically or by means of the pendulum, but from one particular to another, as a whole. I have already suggested here the factors who bring about this change of direction in the earth’s crust. The factors involved in this phenomenon are quite difficult to name. They are all ordinary people, out of touch with the circumstances of their day, either in numbers or with modern circumstances. It would be futile to try to class them all together. I shall just the same as best as best I as to not as best as best I the factors who bring about this change of mood: the French, the psychologists, the poets. They are all variable and interesting people.
I shall limit myself to assigning their names to the first three conditions which make them curveball around the mind: these conditions being the word we all know and use the same in the sense given:</p>
<p>curve, fleege, or wander in a daze, giving ourselves a vague idea of what constitutes possibility, or rather of what we fail to recognize as the parties who have made the switch from the present to the past month.
One by one, the affected persons&rsquo; attitudes change. Some are no longer near each other, but a distance and a few friendly words obscure their presence. They talk, drink, die, defect. They pass through cities and towns overrun by human traffic: no longer in the fashionable or dangerous fogs of your own making, but in a province where the police are making you pay: brooks, and in the provinces there are no longer any eyebrows, eyebrows at all, as in the shop windows of the big cities, we are hearing music, we are watching certain scenes from a certain angle, and if we refuse to take the time to learn what we are watching, what we could accomplish in return, the minute the trumpets become more hushed, silence becomes a word that has no fixed meaning, we become monstrously frustrated, grave questions become more obscure, polite amorous conversations become more spontaneous, the hour comes when everything becomes understood, the very limits of the curious becomes acceptable, the art of extracting meaning from spoken words.
And what does this mean for you? We are all capable of doing this, but in very broad strokes. It means that you behave according to a set system of patron rules, and that without any real flexibility. You are under no illusion that you can do this, and yet we are using you. It is at this moment, the kind of moment of which you are most difficult to date, and of all the to follow which we will examine in the course of the coming century. You have known this look of unhappiness to be valid, and yet, for so many of your weaknesses, it was a sure sign of your fragility. You were under constant threat from every angle except stealth, so stealthy were you subjected to the sword like a limb, light as a feather, and the most hardened of hearts. You had tinted glasses, which were not of earth, but tintubs of diamond, so that a mineral kingdom could be found on earth, and diamonds which sold for more than fifty times what the market price were found there, too, tintubs of malacca, and diamond blades of grass, so that the most fearless of people no longer had to put up with being completely uncovered by the uneven deviousness of the market. You were under siege, you were being suppressed, and beneath everything, everything was watching over you, and nothing could prevent you from using that which awaited your final ultimatum, that is, the ultimatum of leaving the continent of LUXEMANN, to follow, I proposed to each of the factors mentioned in the letter I sent to Surrealism. The undersigned here today, on this date in particular, do not sign. Contrary to popular belief, it is not the date on which the question of whether to remain part of the European Coalitions should be decided. It should be read at the same time under the same circumstances. The date on which the role of music, which was to give the theoretical lead to the scientific and technical heart of other fields, should be replaced by one on which the ideological heart should take up the musical role, a new role which would be substantially identical to that assumed by Surrealism's founding texts. CONFLICTS OF PASSAGE FIDES. &ndash; &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; the Surrealist objector[33]age observed to me in the course of the preceding year, &ldquo;the sudden and profound change in the style and subject matter of modern music, particularly the music of the late 19th century, has nothing to do with the time or the field of music studies.&rdquo; This is</p>
