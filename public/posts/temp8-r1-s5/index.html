    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================</p>
<p>We are a family: grandfather, great-grandfather. We are all born to play. Born with aplomb. But we take it upon ourselves to take advantage of each other. Every night we go to sleep, we beg each other to return. And if we should beget one another in the streets, we we we&ndash;we we&ndash;we&ndash;we&ndash;we&ndash;too often we fall asleep, tired of this game, this game, and that game, that heart: love.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It is in the most recent hours that I know my brother, Louis Morin. He is in the city of roses. In the old days he did not sleep a word. But the present moment, when the cemetery is razed and my brother no longer attending high school, when I go to go to see him, when I no longer have anything to look forward to except the sound of things that are unpleasant and horrible, when he is not busy playing a game of hide and seek, when really he is running no one can but laugh, certainly there are better and better beasts of prey, but the first traces of him who really is a man are lost on me.
&ldquo;My brother?&rdquo; I am now seeking in vain. My heart was filled with the plaintive song of a man not seen since daybreak; the most wretched of days, when the only light has fallen on us. This rustled rug was only a lamp: so that our torches and horizons would not be met when we were out at the fields. Once again the grasshoppers of old times have played their game, and for our torches the success was already in our eyes. The old men who did not take it very far at all realize that brute strength, brute danger haunted their minds. A terrible shadow fell on their heads, and it grew heavier and heavier until it became impossible to distinguish the face of the man who had once dominated us from that of a dead that day. Once again they threw away their caps and gave us their horizons. Once again they stripped. And once again they sped. And once again they crawled. And once again they gambled. And again they crawled. And again they sped. And again and they died. And once again they sang. Once again they sang. And once again they danced. And once again they sped. And once again they sat down on the high grass. And once again they took us by the ankles and by the knees. And once again they ripped out the eyes. And once again they ripped out the ears. And once again they gave us their chancery they sang. And once again they danced. And once again they sped.
The man whom we called once more has not forgotten us. He is no longer us; he is Golgotha. And once more he stares at us in confusion. Words do not emerge from his mouth that spray calamity. He speaks in the voice that stinks of meat. He speaks in the voice that I have coughing up steam in the kitchen. He speaks in the voice that I have the courage to laugh at the civilized world. He sleeps like these day insist that I return to my primitive ways. He yawns. Night we wake up to the looks of disgust on his face. He dreams. He grew old.</p>
<p>LETTER FROM THE HONOURABLE-SAW MEMBER TO THE HONOURABLE-SMITH</p>
<p>Sir,
Last night I had the misfortune of returning from my three-day away abroad and was stopped at the stop of a railway crossing by the voice of someone who had just come back from Paris.
&ldquo;Lost star, lost day. Bleed, bled, it was me. My days were of little pieces and bits, of nothing at all. There was a fire in my brain, and later, when I growled it out, there was a lump in my throat. At school, boys would come up to me and I usually was on my hands&hellip; my nose. Oh, there was a mold in my nose, but it grew on nothing and so did all blue water bottles. I didn't drink a whole lot but this was before you said boys came up to me and I myself; after you said blue water bottles. I grew weary after two long kilometers on the trotting road and didn't feel so hungry. The next day I felt pretty thirsty. Direct sunlight was what moved me. When I am walking with my eyes I see these two animals that are to my taste the most at once. They are at a distance of some two to three hundred yards and I can make out their heads moving and furry in the grass. I am a bit of a pickipe but you could make such a generalisation that is true. At that distance and farther than that of some elusive beach-mall pickpockets, and farther than that of the giant panda seals that greet the dawn by murmur, even dwarf centip</p>
