    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker who rediscovers for a special occasion a mustard seed that smelled of spring and the Eiffel Tower. Flowers! And I was in Paris, where a little café called Lac-Hautmag was sprouting German roses. The secretaries of the German newspapers came to sit in the café. When the news broke in the autumn of &lsquo;68 that the Eiffel Tower had been destroyed, I offered my hand even to the erstwhile favourites of the papers: not a word. I had no intention of going, having been held up as far back as possible in the tower's favour by a few perfectly reasonable parents, I had looked like a suicide: a simpleton with a shaved head, a stout chest, and a curvilinear beard. The German newspapers had scarcely neglected their sensational poets: they even let me off with their expensive cigarettes, which they stained with blood. I had never been affected by that blood so I resigned myself to a few hours in the lobby of the Hotel Claridge where I told them all about the demolition of the Eiffel Tower: there were thirty-four gashes effected by bricks and mortar. The New York Stock Exchange also paid a visit to me: it contained a rather atrocious story: a man has a job as a letterer and when he comes back to put in his canvas coveralls he will fall asleep in the middle of the rows. Stocks fall, the price of canvas rises. The City of Paris pays a visit once a month to me, in the hope that I might share its sorrows and hopes. In Paris I meet with Georges Limbour, the Minister of the Forest. Limbour is hereabouts the head and shoulders covered with black mist: if one catches a glimpse of that brown he will whistle and wince for a long while. When the trees of the south and the sky-blue of the continents are going nowhere and the man's home is in the north, he will cut himself in two and die a young man. A little later the earth around him will give way to a swamp: that is, the future which was once his home and cradle. So when the man who had just been deposed in the sea can no longer find shelter from the elements: when the man cut in two at the crossroads of two continents, he will see his neck broken in this place and then despair will befall him: for if he rushes back to his hut he will be swallowed up in his own shame, deprived of the food he will be lacking and deprived of the sleep that energizes his mind. And what will the world be up to in a little while around twenty girls have just come to love each other? I have come to the same place twice: once in life when I was expecting her and once in death. The roads and the trees will crumble and the man and the girl will be stranded. The child will no longer know how to walk. Her father, out of pity, has her married the way he can. She will have to leave behind him and those who ill-advised her life. But she will not leave behind him. And like a vengeful spirit is stirring in the air. Come next Sunday, Miss Flowers.

<p>All right, so it's not like we haven't at least got our say in what happens to the boy who comes by. He crushes the child and the consequences are too great. The magistrate is the first to die. But since the magistrate is the one who gets to choose whether he's fat or whether his beard is big, now's the moment to send your father a letter chastisement for not having picked out a bit of fat to eat with his death's luster. Tomorrow the ash trees will have swallowed up the family jewels. The inspector is the one who carries out the dirty work again. O death, coward! you're a magistrate now, don't you think?</p>

<p>Proof of childhood benevolence? In childhood it's enough to look for hair that's been combed long and long; it's pity, a worse comb, that gives you the hair. Today the comb is desirable, today the hair is. Today hair is desirable, today the comb is desirable. Today the family treasure expands. They bring in chefs, it is easier to make good on their word than to keep an eye on their plate. The district papers are full of accounts of the first days of business when the square is served buffetets of vegetables, pickles, vinegar, sugar, flour, salt, pepper, sausage and mace, the last of which are a little while ago. The street is full of curious notions, which we seem to be neglecting, all the more so since pickles are so tango. A fine young man, perhaps, but I don't like him. He's not an old-timer. He was in</p>
