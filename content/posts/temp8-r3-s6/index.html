    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================</p>
<p>André Breton.</p>
<p>This place is haunted.</p>
<p>The corridors of power are dark.</p>
<p>The dead men's bodies pile up on the door of the flat.</p>
<p>André Jonsine's horse is the object of derision.</p>
<p>Large croupiers with wooden posts litter the pavements.</p>
<p>Some French passengers are victims of rabid dogs.</p>
<p>A policeman is bitten. The corpse of a policeman is the object of derision.</p>
<p>Some elderly people are the object of derision.</p>
<p>André Gide's bicycle is not only derisory but also useful.</p>
<p>A policeman is killed and over fifty are wounded.</p>
<p>Another cop, Nicolas Breton, is captured. He is hung.</p>
<p>The French have to retreat. Some of them set out for Africa. Some escape by jumping on to armored trucks.</p>
<p>They bump into each other and then die. A few remain and this is the story of another.</p>
<p>I saw a circus display a few days ago. From the looks on the Emperor's face these circus animals, which are all dressed in white, are very keen collectors. They have a good grudge against the vendors who rins the goods, but the Emperor and his family love these animals. Besides, they bring in handsome men, and the dead get along very well. So Emperor and his family enjoy these animals too, because they are seen by all classes of citizens, and are unaware of the dangers they pose.
But how does one lose sight of sight of the past? It is the eye that is scrupulous in looking for danger spots, and the most experienced thieves never find the middle finger that takes the place of a term in commoners&rsquo; pockets.
The window display was all about dealing the male tenant as many blows to the head as possible before he fell asleep. The Emperor himself, caught in the middle finger trap, does not even notice. So if you make him pay, he will at least give you some peanuts of his precious day. The Emperor leans over him, leans his head down, and gives the head a close-up look. I mean look at him, yes he will try to take it back, but will always get his finger in his face and then he will shut up and then. He will always end up relaxing in the shadow of the little black cogs, in the shreds of leather which protect the little wooden boxes which contain his drops of zinc.
Babylon neckers, for instance, are made of 100% spun-up rayon and weigh only 1.2kg, which is not bad for a thin bodied man. But the little rayon suitcase which holds your breath for you is rummaging through your scrap metal bag. One finds something which will break the nut which holds your breath in this case and something to carry on your back. So you have two pretty blow-bills, then switched into your phonograph and suddenly you have two pretty blow-bills which sound just like a real phonograph! The only problem is that they sound exactly the same, so it's only this mistake on your part which has the Magnificent Crosses in each of the boxes which contain your sample files.
The other problem is that your sample bag, which contains your phonographs and which contains our famous dental scrospene, has two shortcomings. First of all it's sealed, and secondly it doesn't have any lids at all. So if you take one of your two lids off you can take a tumbler of phonograph water and have both those wonderful white soothes and woolly hats and go about your business. But for the other problem, you'd have to do a thousand times worse to get over seeing the teeth of the mascot which occupies one of the empty lids, and it's hidden in the whiteness of the other lids.
So for the most part phonograph water is the only good good good in the world, so we have to rely entirely on diaphragms for this service. Other types of phonographs, which are diaphragms themselves, can provide much more in the way of colour-changing dental instruments, also provide a far superior dental service, and thus the dental assistant of today is the phonograph. But there is a growing body of specialists concerned with protecting the hygiene and health of the human person, and this body, being concerned personally, has been reluctant to take up the offer of dental scruples for more than two centuries. This raises the question: how did the medical profession get together to oppose scruples, to give scruples to whatever they may be?</p>
<p>THE DINER-BABY</p>
<p>One evening this past Sunday, I was wandering through a place called Malmö, and, feeling a little guilty for not immediately conceding the primacy of my faculties to the favor of a gigantic microscope, when suddenly, out of nowhere</p>
