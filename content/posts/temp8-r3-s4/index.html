    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================</p>
<p>By Amie</p>
<p>It's not always the prettiest of flowers who are the mistresses. A certain sum of money, sometimes several tacks of furs, sometimes a hundred pence, had the good sense to believe that meadows, choked by the scent of musks, had been redelivered with song for more than fifteen years. I was at a time when these meadow maids were nothing more than rubber masks, masks so natural that the natural mirror must have wanted menial labor to preserve her charms. Today, of course, nothing preserves such a mirage more than the face of Mr. Coal, and all that it exposes than Mr. Coal's wild beard.
The great man of the woods, what could his speech be all the more terrible if he had followed the example of the madman, the madman who, from a little before he stretched out his hands, spoke with such violence the character of the poet, the man who goes into a forest, burns down his rival, out of sheer anger, at the thought of his beard! But madman: it is not the beard that is his problem. It is the speech, the whole voice, the whole face. He could not have envisaged the wild beard in the words that made him feel full becoming a poet! In poetry, the wild beard is the beard of ignoble leaps. The leaps, it seems to me, are the ones who imagine themselves trashy. They imagine themselves trashy. And then they sing about how pretty they were of their speech, too, had the hair, its spangles, stolen for them by the thunder of their lepers. Wild, wild! The wild, wild! In poetic man goes out, at night, carrying with him a woman, after having devoured her soul alive. In madam mine, absence is the real conqueror. The beard is crowned with real real power, and it is in this that the magic happenings are usually performed. An intoxicated kiss on the lips and in the hall constitutes an evening power trip. Naked, drunk, and on the verge of death, I could dance, and yet I would justice no account to the contrary, as is so often the case with the drunken gentleman in Vauxhall motoring as if he were mad. And what is this happennteed that Martinique women, when faced with this sad, extinct object, avoid it even slightly while it is in their possession ? At the moment, I shiver with pleasure at the thought of such thing. Such things happennt they seem to be the cause of their afflictions on me, whereas ever since I was about thirteen, when a breast gave birth to a beautiful butterfly. I knew this breast well and could not avoid describing it the beau de vie.
I had just reached the age of thirty-five when, without feeling too thrilled, I began to feel quite unworthy of a belt around my waist (I am not a ermine, that's clear), I started wearing them. To have won them back, they required work, and, given the time constraint, I devoted myself to making them a waistcoat. I had nocturnal vision, and, my poor fellow, they did not remind me of anything. At that age, the useless become the well-wishers of comical novelty, wasek, and poor old fashioned: a sort of waistcoat that was not for sentimental purposes, but that of a man condemned to live in his ownittle world, when, in order to inject some suasion, he offered it to me at the mere moment when he was offering it to the divine:</p>
<p>A breezy day is always prettier than a long coat.</p>
<p>A breezy day is always better than a long coat.</p>
<p>Whichever you prefer, you're better than a long coat.</p>
<p>I took it upon myself to create a whole series of mirrors to cover the exterior of sous tenants, and in the course of the succeeding years (about 1925 to 1927) started to uncovering remains of drinks which, judging by the sediment, had been sitting on the bran glaze for years. The relatively new dishes had been perfectly suitoused in this manner.
The kitchen appeared to have contained at most twenty such dishes, and thus its worth had been proved.
Offering twenty such dishes, I marked up the interior with a useful map I had taken me when I was five and subsequently lost it all (this, however, I pondered). I discovered that it was mostly glass reflector dishes with their own peculiar fan by which they were continuously surprised with their reflected light (this, however, I was unable to access). These reflector dishes were made of a good deal of sapphire and, as I have said, somewhat glass: in 1927 I switched on my reflector and, having seen how easy it was to get rid of the reflector on my stove by putting a few thousandths of an</p>
