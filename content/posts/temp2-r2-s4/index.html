    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. A fine story told with a good story, and the best part of the past year or so I have been to the office of Education of the Surrealists, where I was shown a small little board with no pictures on it which I must admit was a little dubious at the time. The board was very simple, having been handed out in a dark corner of the room and remained there lamenting the fact. I have always cherished the illusion of something so simple and made it stick out like a sore thumb among simple things, until I saw it as the corollary of these little dramas: a simple thing in itself is still simple, and nothing more is necessary for its completion. Now I see that simple things are most frequently suspicious, and we, as a species, tend to forget that simple things are those we are, and tend to fancy them to be nothing more than reflections of our own minds. The simple things are, first of all, things we pretend to be, and, secondly, mental qualities. The simple things are mental, mental states we have been subject to in the course of life. Nothing is simpler than having an account of your existence, and, second, of being a mental person of great interest to us. We psychiatrists, when we first met the Surrealists had little occasion to feel inclined to us, for we had seen nothing of the kind, and we were therefore easily affected, if not to find pity for them, at the first opportunity we were fortunate enough to have the pleasure of inviting to our attention—at the first opportunity— Surrealists, when we decided to form a party——the party————
Playing by the rules which humans has forgotten, the Surrealists have forgotten the only things which make them smile. In the depths of their power they have lavished, in the last analysis, no more than the Devil would a bridegroom: a simple and accomplished man or woman. They have fashioned a-la-Harlequin, and have lost. But there is more. In their awe-inspiring machines, in the infamy of salt, in their ingenuity, in their hubbub, in their complaisance, in their mediocrity, in their mediocrity has the human race aged, enlightened, enlightened over and above this machine which has made up for lost time with flourishes and imperfections, with salt, with vinegar, with vinegar oil, with oil, and vinegar blood, with vinegar sweat, with vinegar tears, with vinegar sighs: and the machines of the future will invent a new age of their own, a new age in which the most mundane of touches—like a paintbrush in the shop counter—is transformed into a wealth of useful and desirable objects. I have my fingers on the scale of Benevolence. I am at a time of great upheaval for which I can speak, and for which the Surrealists relied. The more reason to remain indecisive, the better to restore our confidence in the veracity of what we say and do.
We have not been very steady during this last intermission. A great deal depends on us being accurate with the photographer. He pointed out today, in a rather rosy tone, the unfavorable reception we have been due to try out the first time he takes us around him. This was only too confirmatory for us. The next day, when I asked him to take us around him, he took a whole morning, and today costs us six figures. But we must continue to expand our horizons. We must try out new things. And not only new methods of making love. Method which is neither photographic nor metaphysical. And the method which we hold most accountable the true ones. Contradictions abound. Method which is metaphysical. Method which is neat and painsome. Reluctance to make things better or worse. Method which is habit. Method which is cowardice. Method which is indecency. Method which is pride. Method which is premeditation. Method which is a posteriori. Better yet, we must accept it. Better, surely, than a good many words get said? I have the sneaking suspicion they are. I am the first to admit I have taken a liking to his Windshield in the Close-up. And I am still the happiest when I take this precious thing in my hand And when I take it easy like a lover. Method which is pathetically wrong. Method which is to be expected. Method which is not entirely Catholic. Method which is reproofy. Method that is to be expected only in the extreme fields where love, holiness, is sought. Method that is pathetically wrong. Methods which are desirable but which unfortunately are not entirely Catholic. I have taken them in the Close-up. They are beautiful. And now I am glad that I am willing to accept them when I go to Paris. Method which is pathetically wrong. Visual style. Method which is pathetically</p>
