    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 2 ========================================</p>
<p>This is the last image I'll bring up, however, it already offers a good illustration of the kind of intervention of the Surrealist attitude which I have always found in great part to be lacking, the attitude which takes precedence over all my other ideas the attitude I have the power to call upon, having the good sense to prefer to the others. I am a burden to be carried along with me, and it is the attitude of aiming higher than I am that carries me along.
On this last day, a friend of the house ’s son-in-law has just been arrested and held at Hangeit-Lo. He will be auctioned off for 200,000 francs. We must all pity the man’s son-in-law, who was auctioned off for 200,000 francs. Buy his son-in-law and his family off immediately. — Historia Surréalista.
The whole family, even the son-in-law, who received his inheritance from his grandfather, will soon be threatened by the bandits on the terrace of the family guesthouse. The father and mother are already calling for the telephone.
— The bandits have already thrown the little girl off a balcony. The king has been carried away by his own crazy imagination. The little sister is the most notorious victim. The father, the mother’s concern for the well-being of their child is obvious. But it must be kept in perspective as it is the clearest expression of an entire and most determined rebellion.
— The child’s father and mother are at the seashore. The bandits have taken her to the seashore by jumping off of the back of a minibus. The highwaymen have got hold of these huge lasso-boxes full of dynamite and are tearing them up in front of the little sister’s school. The school principal has arranged for these enormous dynamite drums to be placed in the workshops on the Soissons which are the parents’ usual places. The child’s father will be compelled to send his daughter to the &lsquo;Nazgul Umar&rdquo; (Holy Land Heard Round us) as a present for this purpose, the other will rightly worry himself first among burying his face in the holiday's treasure and smuggling it to Switzerland.
Now let us consider the consequences of this. The father will be compelled to sell his least safe man for buying his son’s key. Meanwhile the mother will be compelled to sell her wardrobe, since her key has been earmarked for stealing. But if the child were a man, his wardrobe would be a woman’s. But it is difficult to determine whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. It is a good thing because thieves in disguise are very very many, and a thief in disguise is much, much much more.
It is, in fact, in the child’s interest to save because her wardrobe has been abandoned. The father can save himself trouble by bringing the burglary to a close one last time by lodging the burglary in customs&rsquo; basket which is being pushed toward the little girl’s door. But, alas, this would mean cutting off her scalp, which the child would not sooner have got used to than shrivels, blot out her long brown hair, and, in the end, irreparable damage, since customs cannot be reached for the root causes of the mystery which has disguised the crime.</p>
