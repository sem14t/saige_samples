    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 8 ========================================
I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. I have even written myself about his day to the day, touching on trivial subjects. At the end of one of his biographies, M. de Goncourt-Bouteille recounts, without ever actually looking at it, a letter he wrote to his friend and friend in Paris, M. Aragon, who was writing a book about magic:
Dear friend,
I have long since been attracted to your style of communication, in which the object of the pursuitâ€™s miracle is presented, rather than the other way round, a number of plausible denouements. The most recent being the famous &ldquo;halo effect,&rdquo; in which the supple illusion of a dark magic supposedly exerteds and moderated my reverie.
In France magic is a reality, and France aspires to be the home of such magic. It is to those objects of homage that we are most anxious, not to mention those objects which we ourselves deny. In the old days magic effects were nothing but symbols on poles, and poles had everywhere shared our love of illusion.</p>

<p>THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF DEALING IN NATURE</p>
<p>The charm of death is in the eye of the beholder. Age and sex do not exactly correspond. Age conceals more than sex. It curses. Age worships those who are put to it. The old man of the guild restored by age has delegated more power to his hands than he could ever have wished to know the secret of death. He has delegated even more power to the holes in the rolled-out window display case. He has delegated even more power to the cold blooded decapitations. He has delegated even more power to the cold water that is a new cold to kill off wild horses.
He who was already dead had not lost all immortality. Death made him immortal.
The stake had been accurately reassessed. The faithful knew that he had not withdrawn at the last minute. A great silence had surrounded the funeral. The coffin had been unveiled. Everyone had felt a desire that must remain unbounded to repeat itself.
The coffin had been shrouded in silence for more than ten minutes. The blood had trickled down from the hands of the eyes who had been waiting for it so rigorously.
The blood had trickled down from the coffin into the eyes of a man whose tie had finally been undone. He had been the victim of a fatal blow while on the front lines.
A delegation of the world community had met the new president. They discussed the need to improve the care of the signatures. The coffin had been refinished in such a way that it no longer interfered with the natural redemptive mission of the new people.

<p>The new people had spent three days preparing the coffin. The chairs were falling apart. The table was left unfinished. The table was left unfinished.
The new people had spent the evening in the same room as the American ambassador to the UN.</p>
