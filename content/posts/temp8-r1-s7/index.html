    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================</p>
<p>I have found a simple way of making the cracks in the walls of silence disappear. A simple light saber is stretched out on the table.</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>LIKE A COLD STORM</p>
<p>By SUN</p>
<p>From the depths of silence</p>
<p>Alight from love that fades</p>
<p>From the fleeting</p>
<p>Through the lukewarm night</p>
<p>Through nothing at all</p>
<p>Perhaps there are other lovers</p>
<p>Like us</p>
<p>We are like you</p>
<p>LTE**M2t</p>
<p>• We are like you (Kazuo, March 17th, &lsquo;14)</p>
<p>• We are like you (Kazuo, March 17th, &lsquo;14)</p>
<p>LIKE A DENSE STORM</p>
<p>By SKY</p>
<p>From the depths of silence</p>
<p>Alight from icy silence</p>
<p>From gentle murmuring</p>
<p>Through nothing but the blue sky</p>
<p>The only thing we can think of of you are those shells your eyes lost</p>
<p>Of your eyes all we can think of are our emotions, our thoughts, our inclinations, our inclinations within ourselves, an abnormal level of calm within us, a lake of silent bravado, a calm ocean, which we can gulp down, lose ourselves saying Goodbye to each other, and feel safe around others.</p>
<p>LIKE A TEMPLE</p>
<p>By SUN</p>
<p>From the depths of silence</p>
<p>Alight from blue kisses</p>
<p>From silence protected by silence</p>
<p>The only thing we can think of is your face.</p>
<p>THE SEASONS</p>
<p>May the force of memory</p>
<p>Of new memories</p>
<p>May undo the days.</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>Seen From: Hollywood</p>
<p>To help you with your ink-and-painting problem</p>
<p>You turn to a Persian or a German or a American and</p>
<p>The two women you hold</p>
<p>Applauding you from every angle</p>
<p>Declare to you the love of your eyes have never seen</p>
<p>And the spark that rages between them</p>
<p>Seek your mirror but your brows lucid</p>
<p>You turn back as a child once did</p>
<p>Instead of a eyelash you turn a peacock.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the model you hold</p>
<p>Was himself capable of giving</p>
<p>He who gave you the idea of your house</p>
<p>You turned into a tree but now you are</p>
<p>And the spindlework of your head he neglected.</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, the model you do have</p>
<p>Your own bedroom and your room in a big room</p>
<p>In another room but not in a big one</p>
<p>In a hotel but not in one but two people bed</p>
<p>In the same room</p>
<p>In one but not the other</p>
<p>In one but not the other</p>
<p>In the other</p>
<p>Which is bad enough when their hands are full of your blood</p>
<p>When they refuse to take your forbidden plunge</p>
<p>When you insist they be put to an operation.</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>LIKE A SEA</p>
<p>By mental distance</p>
<p>There is neither sun nor moon</p>
<p>There is but the open sky</p>
<p>There is but the open sky</p>
<p>There would be to fly long before the two of you</p>
<p>Would meet</p>
<p>During a long life of sojourns that has seen you go to the best seaside resorts</p>
<p>The one that takes your place</p>
<p>The one who knows everything</p>
<p>And keeps it in mind that</p>
<p>He goes on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going on going going on going going on going going on going going going on going going going going going</p>
<p>You will always keep my hand in my coat</p>
<p>All those reproaches from the first day</p>
<p>That always makes me regret not a beat.</p>
<p>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</p>
<p>THE PASSAGE BOARD</p>
<p>LET ME CONTINUE</p>
<p>THE EXQUISITE DIFFERENCE OF SELF</p>
<p>A certain gentleman sitting at’t his POLICE COMMENTS tab having been unable to sort out the incomprehensible mystery concerning a letter he was reading on one of his typewriters arose and said
’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced entirely to the page I was reading in myself.’ That is a fact, and a great deal more will be said.
He went on to add:</p>
<p>’But the mystery behind all these strange and wonderful comments has been traced quite simply, and is fully revealed to me.
It is this gentleman who happens to be sitting at the top of his copy-pushing in the direction of Ahab, who proceeded to write:</p>
<p>’I understand perfectly well why a certain man in the vicinity of the People’s Museum in New York City would try, at the page where I find it, to connect with an improbable or misleading connection.</p>
