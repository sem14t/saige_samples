    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 4 ========================================</p>
<p>Our country is in a state of emergency, which means that the only thing that can be expected from it is that civil war break out in the north-east of France, between the Communist Party of Great Britain and Ireland and the Revue la peinture ise, which seeks to take France by force of arms. Ireland, which occupies the frontiers of both the two countries&rsquo; main ports of transport, boasts one of the world's largest Communist parties, which has also been of great help to the Party of Ireland in this struggle. Meanwhile, the French army, already stretched thin by the war, is threatening to withdraw when the breakneck British and Irish forces pass through the Canal at the close of the quarter-finals of the 1914 FIFA World Cup. Then, the combatants of the two continents are thrown into a full-blown war, as is the case with the provisional government in the Far East, which is led, along the Turkish story, by an Italian whose father is an Italian. Sooner or later, the various wings of the Party of Italy are forced to choose between toppling one of its leaders, or upholding a constitution which is, at the moment, unable toot or noot, while the other remains unconcerned with the prestige of its membership in the European Union, and with preserving its place in the international chessboard by winning. The leaders of both parties in both the National and National Interest parties in each of those constituencies which won: for example, that square which in the Anglo-Saxon country was the field of Poitiers no longer exists, that square which in modern times, Porte Saint-Denis, has, until now, been won by Generalissimo Desnos over his British opponent. Henceforth, Desnos is the one who shall avoid the decisive role which, in the opinion of most people, Desnos played in the creation of the country which became Great Britain under the pretext of restoring the principle of the equivocal. Desnos himself, without experiencing the slightest of the vacillation that is so characteristic of the Partido Partie della Grande Reform, made such a pronouncement as one may suppose taken from the lips of a man who loves this country:
&ldquo;The country’s fault, their institutions&rsquo; misfits’ fault, the incompetence of the various parliaments’ miseries. It is such a feeling that I can be sure to keep quiet. It’s a pity, really, that the Country majority of five should have to see through the idiocy of counting its electoral votes, without considering it the duty of my colleagues to make absolutely certain that this happens once and for all, and that, moreover, it does. It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that a people so fond of floating above its field so much reduced to idle chatter and waning memory should betray and utterly betray its past, its great principles. I shudder to think of the illusion of Academia, of Celle Radiogriff, or Canal+ that might have stood up there without its coat tails!
&ldquo;Napoli! I cry when I see Artur Masudi play at the lacrosse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A short while before the first game of the second leg of the League table tennis tournament was played an accident, a sudden and inevitable falling on the hardest of both slopes of the Maritimes (the falling snow of which Mr. Coal was the prime suspect), which made the roofs of Paris crumble, the railways dissolve, telephone poles shake, and the splendid glacial lakes overrun the country of which boats could not make ends meet because the mooring of streams was interrupted by the loud clack of cocks helped to prolong the civil war that was raging for forty years. Suddenly, Mr. Coal realized that the only thing that could be done to save his country’s sheep was to join the civil war for dollars. He bought a house in the Marne (the Marne, as we know, is a sort of Patagonia: square in that case). But he soon discovered that this cheap housing project was not the only mistake he had made. Moreover, the demolition permit he had been granted was not up for approval this morning (6/7). So he stayed put as long as he could get away from home. Unfortunately, this led to him ever again being able to engage in any real argument with any of the people he wanted to meet, the patron of these ridiculous gatherings whom I will call The Minister of Memory, and whose behavior the meeting gave me the bad name of. He ended up spending the night in a London cell, where he continued arguing with himself all night long. Eventually, the victim, who was extremely kind to me, asked me to come and we went down to the La Chapelle de Monte-Carlo. Nadja said that Mr. Coal, who was rubbing shoulders with Morwhe? and Cynthia, was drunk with some kind of dastardly genius. A very sad day for them both. Then,</p>
