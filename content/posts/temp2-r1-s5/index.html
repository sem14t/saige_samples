    <p>======================================== SAMPLE 5 ========================================</p>
<p>I have always loved to hear the parricide of the most important considerations of life. It is a pity that the advice of a psychiatrist is no longer being given to the service of which it is furnished.
Psychiatrist, you are an affront to psychiatry. You have turned a blind eye to the epidemic! It is not my job to go and see it. I shall be called upon to say what has been the cause of the present disorder. But since you have such a point of view, it would be a crime for me not to have one of those opposite one of the two main outlooks which have brought about this state of affairs. You have no business in leading a house of worship which I revere. No religion, no business. I shall be damned, like you, if I am not careful to show my face in public. I shall greet the stars with the same dignity I do with the gift of my mind to surgery. I will look at you in a way which is both familiar and respects your kind of expression.
I am sojourning in your house is not the first time I met a psycho. It is a common trick for people to becalme them, and it is funny what happens when this communication is done with the fake name of the probate judge. Trafalgar Square, real estate agent, with fake beard, I shall be sure to tell you everything. The real purpose of your letter of departure is to obtain a divorce from Trafalgar Square. I don't live there any more. I leave itaratical to you.
My wife, your heart breaks at the mention of my name. Why should I bother to inform you about the court's decision on a suit brought by one of the tenants of this square against the company which occupies it, the City of London Council? The tenant, a man with a complex history of mental illness, has won, by a preposterous margin, considerable concessions for the demolition of the second floor of the Hotel Dupont. But the concession might have gone a step further, for if the lease had not been in effect this objection might not have been raised to the third floor by now that the alarm bells have been sounded. This objection might have been raised by the tenant who occupies the groundfloor of the Hotel Doubleday with a violent history of malignant tendencies. But the matter is before the competent judicial district.
I have no intention of changing this sign in my view. I merely regret that this square which so many of our fellow-tesks and travellers consider our homespun and comforting, at the very moment when we need it the most, most in order to rest, is being used up completely of all belonging to the world’s mass and unendowed mass. It is time to leave it, and since this sign is expecting the world, I am behaving badly at home.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My wife’s body, a fine piece of furniture, was the only thing that kept me from leaving this room. We have not eaten since, and it is very dark. The clock on the door says noon. We have not eaten since. The walls of the room are covered with posters that say:
MONDAY</p>
<p>MONDAY</p>
<p>MONDAY</p>
<p>The walls are adorned with signs that say:
THE SPEAKER
1225 N.E.</p>
<p>The doctor is open to any stranger. He will give the street address. He also offers to give taxi drivers and police officers a taxi if they sign up at his window. The policeman, a 25-year-old with a long criminal history, will be happy to take the car with the red-faced young man. But the young man, the young woman, he offered to take the car with the same tint. We have had great pleasure in showing you, in this instance, how easy it is to get carriedlled by the idea of the young woman we are talking about. She was quite taken with the whole affair. She knew quite well that we would go to Mar-Renee, where the funeral of the Biennale BiD is to be arranged, but she added: &ldquo;It’s not like Mar-Dor. It’s not like Mar-Dor. It’s pretty there if you like.&rdquo; We shall see next year, after the funeral of course. She was a real survivor. I was last night remembered in her home town, the big one for sure.
As for the other residents of the world, they are all too aware of the dangers they risk when they live by these conventions: the high street (Rue de la Chausée), the high street itself (L’Industrie), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), the high street itself (Lower Rue de la Grande Armée), etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc</p>
