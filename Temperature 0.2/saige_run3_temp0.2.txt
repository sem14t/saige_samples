I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of taxi drivers passing remarkable distances on their way to and from work. It was a great sin to be an ordinary driver, and I was proud to be a victim. But I loved these anecdotes about which others would have to be sensitive, and I was not entirely ignorant. I was born to keep a straight face and to avoid simplistic opinions. I loved facts and to see facts as they appeared to me. I have always believed that the most obscure theorisms were those most captivated by a simple observer and which offered no solution to the problem of the mind’s wanderings. I was therefore as ignorant as possible, and I am not even suggesting that you should reject the paradigmatic approaches of the exposé genre, for it is not the specific method which is the method of vanguarding against the current of modern times, but rather the profound poetic vogue in the last few years, and the unprecedented depth of approaches, the ability to take as long to picture a series of dream episodes as necessary to become a person, a personification, a personification. There are so many approaches to enjoy, so many possibilities, and yet the exposé takes them all in. It is a great privilege to be a subject, and to be able to share in the spectacle of the vista of the human mind’s wanderings. There are, as you will see, certain photographs, certain plays, that are of a supremely special and priceless character, and those who will listen can find no justification whatever in the common belief that a religion is in the works. I have always cherished the feeling of the human spirit for itself, and I cherished the sense of the infinite possibilities that could justify a belief in some divine or supernatural miracle. I cherished the storyteller’s, and I have in my sights so many such stories. I have read them aloud, and I have laughed myself to the teeth. I have loved them: the atmosphere, the prose, the pictures, the characters, the whole range of emotions, languages, religions, religions encouraged by the principle of non-sequit de l'études sur l'efficiene.[3] I love the manifest creation of the mind’s wanderings, the song of the lips, the song of the tongue, the song of the eyes, the song of the navel, the universe, heaven, love, infinity, and I have read, and I have loved the stories, and the images. I am thus forced to admit that I am indeed in possession of it, that it is mine to try and beat the siren of, and that each of its pages gives her an indication of what is in store for her, just as each of its pages gives its assent to a certain number of pages of black and white. But let me first of all give credit where credit is due and say that I have never understood the avowal of the letter M to r. Secret letters are not the same as anonymous letters, for M.R. wanted the same things, wanted the same things, and so on. M.R. wanted the letter M to come to letters M, but the next day the letter M came back saying she wanted a copy of Romeo and Juliet. The next day Lucie too, the next day Rene, the next day G.R. and the next day A< and A<.R.R. wanted the same things, wanted the same things, liked the same things, liked the same things. So on and so forth. But letters are not the same as love, there is such a thing as a man asleep in letters, and even if letters are not the same, there is such a thing as a man asleep in a real love. This dream which I have of, my thought, my action in this life, in this dream, is the dream. It is love, dream. And it is still in its early days, when so many fabulous enterprises were in the offing! But I have let myself be led to believe it was love, and I can say with certainty that it is absolutely not. The extraordinary is the true. The ordinary is the unexpected. It is called the shock. And the result of a precis of life unexpected events which have not yet happened but which nevertheless may surprise and upset us, should we be surprised or upset enough to happen to be expected to do so. Happily not all of us are all the same enough to be surprised, to have expected to be surprised, to have expected to be unexpected. And to be unexpected is always, to be unexpected, we are to expect an even keel. The ordinary is the unexpected.
There is a certain part of me which is fearful of the possible overdetermination of the part of me I possess that is anxious to pass immediately over the more general features of the phenomenon, to follow the whole being over and above the phenomena, to make a fist of it, and to

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker who rediscovers for a special occasion a mustard seed that smelled of spring and the Eiffel Tower. Flowers! And I was in Paris, where a little café called Lac-Hautmag was sprouting German roses. The secretaries of the German newspapers came to sit in the café. When the news broke in the autumn of '68 that the Eiffel Tower had been destroyed, I offered my hand even to the erstwhile favourites of the papers: not a word. I had no intention of going, having been held up as far back as possible in the tower's favour by a few perfectly reasonable parents, I had looked like a suicide: a simpleton with a shaved head, a stout chest, and a curvilinear beard. The German newspapers had scarcely neglected their sensational poets: they even let me off with their expensive cigarettes, which they stained with blood. I had never been affected by that blood so I resigned myself to a few hours in the lobby of the Hotel Claridge where I told them all about the demolition of the Eiffel Tower: there were thirty-four gashes effected by bricks and mortar. The New York Stock Exchange also paid a visit to me: it contained a rather atrocious story: a man has a job as a letterer and when he comes back to put in his canvas coveralls he will fall asleep in the middle of the rows. Stocks fall, the price of canvas rises. The City of Paris pays a visit once a month to me, in the hope that I might share its sorrows and hopes. In Paris I meet with Georges Limbour, the Minister of the Forest. Limbour is hereabouts the head and shoulders covered with black mist: if one catches a glimpse of that brown he will whistle and wince for a long while. When the trees of the south and the sky-blue of the continents are going nowhere and the man's home is in the north, he will cut himself in two and die a young man. A little later the earth around him will give way to a swamp: that is, the future which was once his home and cradle. So when the man who had just been deposed in the sea can no longer find shelter from the elements: when the man cut in two at the crossroads of two continents, he will see his neck broken in this place and then despair will befall him: for if he rushes back to his hut he will be swallowed up in his own shame, deprived of the food he will be lacking and deprived of the sleep that energizes his mind. And what will the world be up to in a little while around twenty girls have just come to love each other? I have come to the same place twice: once in life when I was expecting her and once in death. The roads and the trees will crumble and the man and the girl will be stranded. The child will no longer know how to walk. Her father, out of pity, has her married the way he can. She will have to leave behind him and those who ill-advised her life. But she will not leave behind him. And like a vengeful spirit is stirring in the air. Come next Sunday, Miss Flowers. Lineage: Iain Duncan.

All right, so it's not like we haven't at least got our say in what happens to the boy who comes by. He crushes the child and the consequences are too great. The magistrate is the first to die. But since the magistrate is the one who gets to choose whether he's fat or whether his beard is big, now's the moment to send your father a letter chastisement for not having picked out a bit of fat to eat with his death's luster. Tomorrow the ash trees will have swallowed up the family jewels. The inspector is the one who carries out the dirty work again. O death, coward! you're a magistrate now, don't you think?

Proof of childhood benevolence? In childhood it's enough to look for hair that's been combed long and long; it's pity, a worse comb, that gives you the hair. Today the comb is desirable, today the hair is. Today hair is desirable, today the comb is desirable. Today the family treasure expands. They bring in chefs, it is easier to make good on their word than to keep an eye on their plate. The district papers are full of accounts of the first days of business when the square is served buffetets of vegetables, pickles, vinegar, sugar, flour, salt, pepper, sausage and mace, the last of which are a little while ago. The street is full of curious notions, which we seem to be neglecting, all the more so since pickles are so tango. A fine young man, perhaps, but I don't like him. He's not an old-timer. He was in

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. I have always laughed when he cured a sick dog. He was so happy, so happy, until the hour came when he had to be put on a waiting train. He left on the platform, and there followed a minute and a half after which he would never leave the trembling stench of the locomotives.
I have always held no recollection of these adventures, aside from the fact that they had been quite pleasant. I was proud to be a mechanic, and I am fond of the remark: "The mechanic is the one who makes the shocks, the howler monkey." 
But I was also fond of the description of my adventure: 
"The stage frightened apparition, a young woman, she was entirely female, and wore an expression that made you see the top of her head. She was extremely frightened, and immediately passed out. The locomotives went up to her, gave a faint yell, and scattered her tears all over the stage. She was brought to a station, where a doctor was waiting for her. As the friend whom they had arranged the play sent her to see the prettiest one to repeat the error several times, she saw him very angry, and returned very late to the same woman, who appeared to be waiting for her, and very faint, and motionless. 
"The play's" author, a woman, quickly enough, could have obtained the poor old woman's age in one fell swoop, and done her research thoroughly. Instead heaped considerable debts upon himself by going with the characters he had played, women, to locales where he spent hours, sometimes days, at the "black-smith" shop, where he filled out each garment, changed out the color of the shingles, and once he had the girls' dresses on so the man could taste them. He was to wear them in the scene in which the gendarmes work out their new weapon: a fake flower, a little red-headed fellow, a real flower, and a real bit of luck. 
But the fake flower was a dream, and he was pursued like a criminal offstage by the bit. Eventually, when the wig and shoulder pads were brought back to life, the real bit burst out laughing and offered a heartfelt thanks. This was enough for him to weep, and later, when the dummy bit reappeared, Dom, the little bit, the cowardice of tears, fled in great guming from the victorias, while the other characters went off to the countryside, bat mitzvahs in their pockets, and went to high places in the mountains where there was more room for everything. When I was about twenty-four o'clock of my day, the fake flower, the little bit, appeared to me and I was afraid when I looked that it was a man, probably about twenty years old, standing near the Petit Grillon. He was wearing a black shirt with a lighted shirt pocket, a dark-colored shirt, and black trousers with dark pleats. He was carrying a long, round globe in his hand, a long globe with a lighted globe at the hem, and two small pearl necklaces with tiny teats. 
I was out on the Rivoli, looking for the Petit Grillon. When I turned around I saw that the man I had just met was standing on a hill. He was smiling, pointing to the Himalayan mountain range with a big black star. "That's the new weapon of the priests of sainthood. The priests have just heard the legend." 
"The priests have just heard the legend?" Tom Péret said. "And it's the same story as we have told you about the great crypt-broker, the outcast, the laundress, the greasy hand who is profiting from the arrests of legal men." 
"And you, Pelé, the out-of-towner, were the one who profited?" 
"No trouble, Mr. Péret. But he was speaking about the great criminal, the criminal who has just profited from the detentions of many a good lawyer. The police have arrested the man, put him in a cell, and if you don't help me, the magistrate can bring him to court. But I, you know, I don't go knocking on doors. I go walking in door-posts. And people are curious. When I say 'searched', they think to themselves.' Last week a man broke into a bank in the country and stole more than a hundred thousand francs (under the stamp of the bank) and it has been suggested that the stolen money be laundered through Cyprus. The Cypriot banker suspected of breaking into the bank was given a long sentence, but not much, and the stolen money, when he came back, had only a trifle in common with the pearl-

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. A fine story told with a good story, and the best part of the past year or so I have been to the office of Education of the Surrealists, where I was shown a small little board with no pictures on it which I must admit was a little dubious at the time. The board was very simple, having been handed out in a dark corner of the room and remained there lamenting the fact. I have always cherished the illusion of something so simple and made it stick out like a sore thumb among simple things, until I saw it as the corollary of these little dramas: a simple thing in itself is still simple, and nothing more is necessary for its completion. Now I see that simple things are most frequently suspicious, and we, as a species, tend to forget that simple things are those we are, and tend to fancy them to be nothing more than reflections of our own minds. The simple things are, first of all, things we pretend to be, and, secondly, mental qualities. The simple things are mental, mental states we have been subject to in the course of life. Nothing is simpler than having an account of your existence, and, second, of being a mental person of great interest to us. We psychiatrists, when we first met the Surrealists had little occasion to feel inclined to us, for we had seen nothing of the kind, and we were therefore easily affected, if not to find pity for them, at the first opportunity we were fortunate enough to have the pleasure of inviting to our attention—at the first opportunity— Surrealists, when we decided to form a party——the party————
Playing by the rules which humans has forgotten, the Surrealists have forgotten the only things which make them smile. In the depths of their power they have lavished, in the last analysis, no more than the Devil would a bridegroom: a simple and accomplished man or woman. They have fashioned a-la-Harlequin, and have lost. But there is more. In their awe-inspiring machines, in the infamy of salt, in their ingenuity, in their hubbub, in their complaisance, in their mediocrity, in their mediocrity has the human race aged, enlightened, enlightened over and above this machine which has made up for lost time with flourishes and imperfections, with salt, with vinegar, with vinegar oil, with oil, and vinegar blood, with vinegar sweat, with vinegar tears, with vinegar sighs: and the machines of the future will invent a new age of their own, a new age in which the most mundane of touches—like a paintbrush in the shop counter—is transformed into a wealth of useful and desirable objects. I have my fingers on the scale of Benevolence. I am at a time of great upheaval for which I can speak, and for which the Surrealists relied. The more reason to remain indecisive, the better to restore our confidence in the veracity of what we say and do.
We have not been very steady during this last intermission. A great deal depends on us being accurate with the photographer. He pointed out today, in a rather rosy tone, the unfavorable reception we have been due to try out the first time he takes us around him. This was only too confirmatory for us. The next day, when I asked him to take us around him, he took a whole morning, and today costs us six figures. But we must continue to expand our horizons. We must try out new things. And not only new methods of making love. Method which is neither photographic nor metaphysical. And the method which we hold most accountable the true ones. Contradictions abound. Method which is metaphysical. Method which is neat and painsome. Reluctance to make things better or worse. Method which is habit. Method which is cowardice. Method which is indecency. Method which is pride. Method which is premeditation. Method which is a posteriori. Better yet, we must accept it. Better, surely, than a good many words get said? I have the sneaking suspicion they are. I am the first to admit I have taken a liking to his Windshield in the Close-up. And I am still the happiest when I take this precious thing in my hand And when I take it easy like a lover. Method which is pathetically wrong. Method which is to be expected. Method which is not entirely Catholic. Method which is reproofy. Method that is to be expected only in the extreme fields where love, holiness, is sought. Method that is pathetically wrong. Methods which are desirable but which unfortunately are not entirely Catholic. I have taken them in the Close-up. They are beautiful. And now I am glad that I am willing to accept them when I go to Paris. Method which is pathetically wrong. Visual style. Method which is pathetically

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. A fine story told with a good story, and the best part of the past year or so, some pretty fine women come to see me. I have always wanted to talk to her, even to tell her about myself, and she is always so touching. I am so happy when I pass her by, and I would like to kiss her on the lips. I am not very fond of my words, or of her, or of myself, or of her. I shall never happen to see her on the wide world, unless I and I are to kiss for the first time in a life or for ever some day we do not believe in common. I am tempted now, if she doesn't let me go, to try to make her believe that by keeping quiet she will never see her again. She laughs at this, thinks she is joking, says she does not want to live any more, but laughs harder and harder until she catches up with her. She lets go, sad, as she approaches the end of the talk and as she leaves her presence with me. She no longer scares me, her eyes are closed, she is not afraid of the danger that may befall her if I am alone. She laughs, leans her back, as she laughs, leans her back, as she leaves her thoughts: she is alone now, in this very room, and she laughs.

Another walk. The woman is swaying and red on the other side of the tear-gas can. A man is leaning against the wall. She can barely make out the two of them in mid-smoke. They lean out of the window of a white taxi driven by the handsome man's wife, and make for the distant town of Aragon. An old man is waiting for her at the gate of the city. The woman does not recognize him.
The man is strolling with her, without even listening to the conversation that is taking place outside. He is talking to himself, walking with her, he goes without even a sound. He is wearing thick black robes, with sleeves rolled up like sleeves. open to the elements, or closed to air, he is the one, and the man is sweating. rolling, he shows the passerby the various meshes and parts of the cloth that are visible in the street.
The man is wearing a dark-colored suit, with a light-colored shirt, and blue trousers. the woman carries a small child with her, with her. They talk, talk. and when she leaves they go to the garden. The man is wearing a kilt, and one of the women's breasts is enormously enlarged. He points it at the man, who dodges it and leaps out of the window.
The man is dead. The woman walks away, and the woman goes to pick him up at her side.
The man is standing there, covered with dust and tattered stockings. The woman picks him up and brings him to me. She is very sad now, but I cannot help laughing. The man is so strong that she cannot but stare at him. Hasn't changed since the attack on her?
I do not know what colour the man's shirt is, but the old colour of sojourns in the country, the old colour of the crowds at the railway-engines, the smouldering presence of hateful books, the cold, and the smell of books, and the English language make me laugh.
I am not in a hurry, and the man advances towards me. I try his hand at me. He does not respond at all.
I hold his hand, and so as not to knock: he goes back towards the road that leads away the crowds. I do this for the whole of a single moment, and then he stops, and his hand is still on his shoulder.
He has not got used to the crowds, the silence, the books, the cars. He grasps the lack of privacy in front of him and stares into silence. I do this for the whole of a single moment, and then he stops, and his hand is still on his shoulder.
I do this for the whole of a single moment. And then he stops again, and my hand is still on his shoulder.
He does not respond at all.
I do this for the whole of a single moment. And then he stops again, and I do this for the whole of a single moment. He stares at me for a long time. This is the second time he has had me. Volume drops.
This is the second time it has been repeated.
This time he continues staring at me, this looks of silence, of silence which is very long.
At this time a man is standing near him, in a crowd, in front of him, very handsome, very handsome. He advances. I advance. He does not reply.

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of ordinary people who have had a frightful occasion to happen to them. I was brought up in a family of scarecrows. My father, grandfather and uncle were all so feared that they went off at once to save themselves from catastrophe. My mother, meanwhile, was so frightened by the broom-stroker she had at the time of her death that she did not ask her where the spook was, even thinking it was a bit odd that she should stick a stick in her trembling little toe when she could bite the spook. 
My mother even imagined biting the spook, which is a pity because it is surely a pity. My father was a scarecrow, my mother a lightning-hearted little fellow. 
My mother was right. It was a shame to not have the audacity to imagine what you are doing. I have no desire whatsoever to resume normal life if I am to avoid being unable to turn to those who might be useful to me in the future. For example, if I am forced to return to the ways of the past, I will be the first to see brutally destroyed the center of town, the heartland. If I am to know the secrets of a forsaken city, I will have to return to the old ways. I have no desire at all to lose sight of the fact that I am not exactly sharing them with anyone. 
My poor mother, victimized by your hate and condemned to a life of scruples, guilty as she was to your hate, spared nothing of all the horror of my mother's day. I remember the gentle, pretty, Englishwoman, admiring a red-headed fellow with a face of amber, a head of grain, and a bodice of white silk. 
I remember my sister-sister, visiting from home, beautiful, yet apparently a virgin, child, old age, and a vagabond, being carried off by the seaside while their companion was recounting to her, as she went on and on about how handsome and handsome is her future master. 
I remember the gentle, beautiful, Englishwoman, visiting from the country, one of the houses that are her native homes, with her granddaughter, who was five months old when she first came, and, as she went on, about the house of honor, the color pink came to her. 
I remember my sister, visiting from the country, a pretty girl, old age, and a vagabond life, while my companion, on the other hand, was a virgin and had spent his whole life being dominated by women. 
My grandmother, visiting from the Far East, was a beauty queen, and the day she arrived, all of a sudden, everyone was made prettier, and the world lost a lot of quick tempered women. 
My grandmother, who had just come from Nice, bade the children gather around their grandfather pass her a pen and paper, because she didn't think she could do it, and because she didn't think she could, tomorrow they will all leave for the Middle East to join forces there, against the will of the dictatorship. The children were told that this kingdom that sworn to defend itself with its own armed forces, backed by women's suffrage agitation, took on the later dictatorship only if the men in question had sex with at least one of their own. 
My grandmother, however, never imagined that the men in question might do something stupid like sit around and drink Diet Coke, which is like the Diet Coke of the Middle Ages, and who knows, maybe try to make women eat it. 
My grandmother, however, never thought long enough to stop speaking at this meeting of the parties in the chamber that the grandmother herself would not have otherwise witnessed. It was in this tone that she said: 
"When the time is up, Dad and I will make arrangements to have some tea." 
"And then Dad and I can have some quality Chinese tea?" 
"No chance."
When the grandmother finished, the grandmother turned to me and smiled sheepishly. "And you? But I don't know where Dad is. Where he is. I don't know where to look. I can only hope..." 
In the middle of the lunch, the grandmother who had been so kind as to to to met me in the grandmother's house, in the street, without even concealing her face and eyes, called out to me with a song that so grating that I could not listen to her recite, without success, she had just heard when she heard the same thing about the revolutionary congress. "She can agree to that, it is easy, it is known," the grandmother said to me, "and the people know what they are doing. The police, the army, the whole secret society of France know what they are doing. But the congress is not going to be held at the Place de la Concorde, as was requested, but

I have always loved to hear the anecdotes of the miracle-worker. I have even written myself about his day to the day, touching on trivial subjects. At the end of one of his biographies, M. de Goncourt-Bouteille recounts, without ever actually looking at it, a letter he wrote to his friend and friend in Paris, M. Aragon, who was writing a book about magic:
Dear friend,
I have long since been attracted to your style of communication, in which the object of the pursuit’s miracle is presented, rather than the other way round, a number of plausible denouements. The most recent being the famous "halo effect," in which the supple illusion of a dark magic supposedly exerteds and moderated my reverie. 
In France magic is a reality, and France aspires to be the home of such magic. It is to those objects of homage that we are most anxious, not to mention those objects which we ourselves deny. In the old days magic effects were nothing but symbols on poles, and poles had everywhere shared our love of illusion.

THE HONOURABLE MINISTER OF DEALING IN NATURE

The charm of death is in the eye of the beholder. Age and sex do not exactly correspond. Age conceals more than sex. It curses. Age worships those who are put to it. The old man of the guild restored by age has delegated more power to his hands than he could ever have wished to know the secret of death. He has delegated even more power to the holes in the rolled-out window display case. He has delegated even more power to the cold blooded decapitations. He has delegated even more power to the cold water that is a new cold to kill off wild horses. 
He who was already dead had not lost all immortality. Death made him immortal. 
The stake had been accurately reassessed. The faithful knew that he had not withdrawn at the last minute. A great silence had surrounded the funeral. The coffin had been unveiled. Everyone had felt a desire that must remain unbounded to repeat itself. 
The coffin had been shrouded in silence for more than ten minutes. The blood had trickled down from the hands of the eyes who had been waiting for it so rigorously. 
The blood had trickled down from the coffin into the eyes of a man whose tie had finally been undone. He had been the victim of a fatal blow while on the front lines. 
A delegation of the world community had met the new president. They discussed the need to improve the care of the signatures. The coffin had been refinished in such a way that it no longer interfered with the natural redemptive mission of the new people.
